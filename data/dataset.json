I sacrifice myself on the crest-jewel of Rasiks, Shyamasundara, who is intoxicated with the sweetness of the intimate 'Keli Leelas' of love that is absolutely divine and beyond the world. I offer myself again and again at the effulgence of Radha Krishn's ornaments, studded with different types of gems and precious stones which shine even in the darkness like a flash of lightning.

I sacrifice myself on Vrishbhanu Nandini Shri Radha, whose eyes are as beautiful and full of the waves of playfulness as those of a deer. I sacrifice myself on the crest-jewel of Rasiks, Shyamasundara, who is intoxicated with the sweetness of the intimate 'Keli Leelas' of love that is absolutely divine and beyond the world. I offer myself again and again at the effulgence of Radha Krishn's ornaments, studded with different types of gems and precious stones which shine even in the darkness like a flash of lightning. Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji says I sacrifice myself repeatedly on the unique pair of beloved Radha and Krishn, made of the essence of the nectar of divine love."

Her vow of being the purifier of the fallen is obvious from the fact that She blesses only that individual soul with divine love who realizes himself to be fallen. That She is merciful towards the humble is proved by the fact that only he who accepts himself to be humble and destitute from the bottom of his heart is blessed with Her love. The testimony of Her vow of being the redeemer of sinners is only this that She cannot even listen to the pathetic call of the individual soul who realizes himself to be a sinner i.e. She becomes extremely overwhelmed with kindness listening to the heart-rending cry of such an individual soul. Again, the shining proof of Her nature of being the protectress of a surrendered soul is that She protects such a soul as Her own life. Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj says that it is only after having taken shelter in Kishori Ji that we always remain carefree, getting rid of good and bad actions forever."

Her vow of being the purifier of the fallen is obvious from the fact that She blesses only that individual soul with divine love who realizes himself to be fallen. That She is merciful towards the humble is proved by the fact that only he who accepts himself to be humble and destitute from the bottom of his heart is blessed with Her love. The testimony of Her vow of being the redeemer of sinners is only this that She cannot even listen to the pathetic call of the individual soul who realizes himself to be a sinner i.e. She becomes extremely overwhelmed with kindness listening to the heart-rending cry of such an individual soul. Again, the shining proof of Her nature of being the protectress of a surrendered soul is that She protects such a soul as Her own life. Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj says that it is only after having taken shelter in Kishori Ji that we always remain carefree, getting rid of good and bad actions forever."

From Vyas Vani, Purvardh (104)\nWhen will we become true Brajwasis (i.e residents of Braj), since Shri Nand Kishor is our master, and our Queen is one and only Shri Radha rani. When will we meet our dearest sakhi friends like Harivanshi (Hita Sakhi) and Haridasi (Lalita sakhi). When will we dwell in Banshivat, sit under Banshivat shade where nearby charming Yamuna is flowing. The same land which is always desired by Goddess like Maha lakshmi and she is humbly standing to get access to this divine land by holding both the hands pressed together. Shri Hariram Vyas incarnation of Shri Vishakha sakhi says, my only desire is to remain in this land called \"Vrindavan\" and serve it incessantly!"

When will we dwell in Banshivat, sit under Banshivat shade where nearby charming Yamuna is flowing. The same land which is always desired by Goddess like Maha lakshmi and she is humbly standing to get access to this divine land by holding both the hands pressed together.

on him and that\u2019s the reason you are not fit to live in the Dham. Please leave Vrindavan as soon as possible. It was very kind of Bhatta to visit me and for my own benefit he wanted to edit my book and you have hurt him. This much you could not tolerate by your Vaishnava grace? Go back to your home and return to Vrindavan when you will be able to be patient.\nAt once Shri Jiva left the place and headed east towards his home. When his mind became peaceful, he decided to remain in a solitary place in the forest as he did not have permission to return to the association of Roop Goswami. He lived here in a hut made of leaves, sometimes he ate a little and sometimes he ate nothing while he passed his time in great distress and lamentation. He thought that if he gave up his life he would be able to obtain the lotus feet of his Lord. In the course of his travels, Sanatan Goswami came to that village. The villagers came forward to welcome him and ask about his well-being. They informed him that one beautiful young Sanyasi had been living in the forest for a long time, eating only a small quantity of fruits or roots or drinking water mixed with atta [flour]. Knowing that this sanny\u00e4s\u00e9 must be Shri Jiva, Sanatan went to see him in great affection. Seeing Sanatan within his patched hut, Shri Jiva could not control himself and fell flat on the ground at Sanatan's feet. The villagers were quite astonished. Sanatan asked Shri Jiva to explain his difficulty and Jiva very lovingly explained everything. After consoling the villagers, Sanatan left Shri Jiva in his hut and went to see Roop in Vrindavan. Hearing of Shri Sanatan's arrival in Vrindavan, Shri Roop went out to meet him. Sanatan asked about the book Bhakti-Rasamrit-Sindhu and Roop said that he had finished writing the book but the editing was incomplete because of Shri Jiva's absence. Sanatan explained the situation to Shri Roop, \u201cJiva is alive, but he is so weak that even the breeze can rock his body.\u201d At once Shri Roop brought Jiva back to Vrindavan and nursed him affectionately. Everyone was happy with Shri Jiva's recovery and Roop-Sanatan bestowed all 76 responsibilities on him. By their mercy, the greatness of Shri Jiva's knowledge spread throughout the world."

on him and that\u2019s the reason you are not fit to live in the Dham. Please leave Vrindavan as soon as possible. It was very kind of Bhatta to visit me and for my own benefit he wanted to edit my book and you have hurt him. This much you could not tolerate by your Vaishnava grace? Go back to your home and return to Vrindavan when you will be able to be patient.\nAt once Shri Jiva left the place and headed east towards his home. When his mind became peaceful, he decided to remain in a solitary place in the forest as he did not have permission to return to the association of Roop Goswami. He lived here in a hut made of leaves, sometimes he ate a little and sometimes he ate nothing while he passed his time in great distress and lamentation. He thought that if he gave up his life he would be able to obtain the lotus feet of his Lord. In the course of his travels, Sanatan Goswami came to that village. The villagers came forward to welcome him and ask about his well-being. They informed him that one beautiful young Sanyasi had been living in the forest for a long time, eating only a small quantity of fruits or roots or drinking water mixed with atta [flour]. Knowing that this sanny\u00e4s\u00e9 must be Shri Jiva, Sanatan went to see him in great affection. Seeing Sanatan within his patched hut, Shri Jiva could not control himself and fell flat on the ground at Sanatan's feet. The villagers were quite astonished. Sanatan asked Shri Jiva to explain his difficulty and Jiva very lovingly explained everything. After consoling the villagers, Sanatan left Shri Jiva in his hut and went to see Roop in Vrindavan. Hearing of Shri Sanatan's arrival in Vrindavan, Shri Roop went out to meet him. Sanatan asked about the book Bhakti-Rasamrit-Sindhu and Roop said that he had finished writing the book but the editing was incomplete because of Shri Jiva's absence. Sanatan explained the situation to Shri Roop, \u201cJiva is alive, but he is so weak that even the breeze can rock his body.\u201d At once Shri Roop brought Jiva back to Vrindavan and nursed him affectionately. Everyone was happy with Shri Jiva's recovery and Roop-Sanatan bestowed all 76 responsibilities on him. By their mercy, the greatness of Shri Jiva's knowledge spread throughout the world."

principal disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and among Six Goswamis of Vrindavan, among whom was his brother Rupa Goswami.\nOnce Sanatana Goswami was alone in the forest on the banks of the Pavana Sarovara performing his bhajan in a secluded place. He had been fasting from food and drink. As he is the supersoul in all living beings, the Lord could understand everything. He thought, \"My devotee is starving. I cannot tolerate this.\"\nIn the dress of a gopi, Krishna entered the forest where Sanatana was staying, carrying a pot of milk. He came before Sanatana and said, \"Baba! I have brought you some milk.\"\nSanatana said, \"Why have you brought me milk?\"\n\"You are not eating properly, that's why.\"\n\"How did you know that I am not eating anything?\"\n\"Many gopas have come and gone by here. They told me you have not been eating.\"\n\"Why didn't they come?\"\n\"They have much work at home, so they sent me.\"\n\"You are such a little boy, why have you taken so much trouble for me?\"\n\"No, no, father. It is no trouble at all.\"\nTaking the pot of milk, Sanatana said, \"Sit down, little boy. I will finish the milk and give you back your pot.\"\n\"No baba. I cannot sit with you. I have to milk the cows. I will come and fetch the pot tomorrow.\"\nSaying this, the boy vanished, and Sri Sanatana became speechless. He could understand that all this was the work of Krishna. He began to drown in the tears that poured from his eyes as he drank the milk. From that day on he ate by practicing madhukari, or only accepting a tiny bit from many different residents of Vrindavana. Gradually the residents of Vrindavana built him a kutir so that he could stay there. Braj Dham ki Jai. Albeli Sarkar Ki Jai."

principal disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and among Six Goswamis of Vrindavan, among whom was his brother Rupa Goswami.\nOnce Sanatana Goswami was alone in the forest on the banks of the Pavana Sarovara performing his bhajan in a secluded place. He had been fasting from food and drink. As he is the supersoul in all living beings, the Lord could understand everything. He thought, \"My devotee is starving. I cannot tolerate this.\"\nIn the dress of a gopi, Krishna entered the forest where Sanatana was staying, carrying a pot of milk. He came before Sanatana and said, \"Baba! I have brought you some milk.\"\nSanatana said, \"Why have you brought me milk?\"\n\"You are not eating properly, that's why.\"\n\"How did you know that I am not eating anything?\"\n\"Many gopas have come and gone by here. They told me you have not been eating.\"\n\"Why didn't they come?\"\n\"They have much work at home, so they sent me.\"\n\"You are such a little boy, why have you taken so much trouble for me?\"\n\"No, no, father. It is no trouble at all.\"\nTaking the pot of milk, Sanatana said, \"Sit down, little boy. I will finish the milk and give you back your pot.\"\n\"No baba. I cannot sit with you. I have to milk the cows. I will come and fetch the pot tomorrow.\"\nSaying this, the boy vanished, and Sri Sanatana became speechless. He could understand that all this was the work of Krishna. He began to drown in the tears that poured from his eyes as he drank the milk. From that day on he ate by practicing madhukari, or only accepting a tiny bit from many different residents of Vrindavana. Gradually the residents of Vrindavana built him a kutir so that he could stay there. Braj Dham ki Jai. Albeli Sarkar Ki Jai."

Fair complexioned Shri Radha is very wise. When she looks at me with her 'Mrignani' eyes (resembles that of a deer) then, after seeing the same moment, she steals my heart! Fair complexion of her body shines like Gold, and her breasts are like the fruit of the wood apple's tree. The waist of her resembles like an elegant lion, which has got innumerable qualities that seems like it is completely immersed in an ocean of unlimited qualities. The black lavish long hair resembles like a serpent on her beautiful face (which surpass even the combined beauty of crores of moons). Her thighs are like tender banana-leaves. She walks in such an intoxicated manner as to put even a swan to shame. Shri Krishn says to Shri Hita Harivansh Sakhi, \"Oh Harivansh, Listen, Please arrange her meeting with me by any means possible, in the forest today. Although she performs \u201cMaan\u201d (anger) leela often, she is extremely innocent, gracious and generous. I hope after listening to my plea from you, she will definitely meet me today in the forest bowers of Vrindavan.\""

Fair complexioned Shri Radha is very wise. When she looks at me with her 'Mrignani' eyes (resembles that of a deer) then, after seeing the same moment, she steals my heart! Fair complexion of her body shines like Gold, and her breasts are like the fruit of the wood apple's tree. The waist of her resembles like an elegant lion, which has got innumerable qualities that seems like it is completely immersed in an ocean of unlimited qualities. The black lavish long hair resembles like a serpent on her beautiful face (which surpass even the combined beauty of crores of moons). Her thighs are like tender banana-leaves. She walks in such an intoxicated manner as to put even a swan to shame. Shri Krishn says to Shri Hita Harivansh Sakhi, \"Oh Harivansh, Listen, Please arrange her meeting with me by any means possible, in the forest today. Although she performs \u201cMaan\u201d (anger) leela often, she is extremely innocent, gracious and generous. I hope after listening to my plea from you, she will definitely meet me today in the forest bowers of Vrindavan.\""

From his childhood days, He was deeply attached towards Radha Krishna. He had an intense longing for Radha Krishna, he used to wander in an absorbed state of love near Yamuna river and in the jungles of Vrindavan. One day he felt an intense longing for Radharani. He was\nwandering in the bowers of Vrindavan and came towards Raas Mandal and he felt great excitement and deep longing and separation of Radharani. He stayed on that Raas Mandal, thinking what is the use of this body without the vision of Radharani? There is no need to go back to my living place. I will not go from here, till she arrives. The whole night passed and the sun rose. It went down and the second night passed and he did not sleep and like this, days and nights passed.\n\ufeff\nOne night while he was in a state of half awake and half asleep, he heard a jingling sweet sound and after that, he felt a loving touch on his head. Suddenly, He saw Radharani standing in front of him. The sound he heard was the sound of Radharani's anklet and the touch he felt was Radharani's hand on his head. He didn't say anything but Radharani said, \"I will never depart from you. I will always remain with you.\u201d\nAfter receiving the grace of Shri Radha, his whole personality was changed. His self-became one with Radha. He became the form of Radha's love. One of the famous book, he wrote was Bayalis Leela, a book of Forty-two leelas of Radha Krishn."

From his childhood days, He was deeply attached towards Radha Krishna. He had an intense longing for Radha Krishna, he used to wander in an absorbed state of love near Yamuna river and in the jungles of Vrindavan. One day he felt an intense longing for Radharani. He was\nwandering in the bowers of Vrindavan and came towards Raas Mandal and he felt great excitement and deep longing and separation of Radharani. He stayed on that Raas Mandal, thinking what is the use of this body without the vision of Radharani? There is no need to go back to my living place. I will not go from here, till she arrives. The whole night passed and the sun rose. It went down and the second night passed and he did not sleep and like this, days and nights passed.\n\ufeff\nOne night while he was in a state of half awake and half asleep, he heard a jingling sweet sound and after that, he felt a loving touch on his head. Suddenly, He saw Radharani standing in front of him. The sound he heard was the sound of Radharani's anklet and the touch he felt was Radharani's hand on his head. He didn't say anything but Radharani said, \"I will never depart from you. I will always remain with you.\u201d\nAfter receiving the grace of Shri Radha, his whole personality was changed. His self-became one with Radha. He became the form of Radha's love. One of the famous book, he wrote was Bayalis Leela, a book of Forty-two leelas of Radha Krishn."

Haridas ji, incarnation of Lalita Sakhi, used to please Shri Bihariji by sweetly singing devotional songs, he had personally composed as he played the vina. While singing, he would become so absorbed that he would forget his body and mind and kept on singing day and night. The famous Baijubavara and Tansena were his disciples. Upon hearing about Swami Haridasa\u2019s glories from the mouth of Tansena, who was the jewel among Emperor. Akbara\u2019s ministers, Akbarahimself desired to relish the nectar of Haridasa\u2019s blissful music. But Swami Haridas had firmly resolved not to entertain anyone but his deity \"Shri Bihariji\". Therefore one day Emperor Akbara disguised himself as an ordinary man and, along with Tansena, came to Swami Haridas\u2019s bhajana kutira in Nidhivan. Tansena, who also was very expert in music, had purposely brought his vina along and now began to sing a sweet song. His singing enchanted Akbara. Swami Haridasa then took the Vina from the hands of Tansena and began to sing the same song, pointing out the errors that Tansena had made in singing it. Swami Haridasa\u2019s singing was so sweet and attractive that even the deer, birds and other animals of the forest came to that spot, where they listened silently. Emperor Akbara\u2019s amazement knew no bounds. He was so pleased that he immediately wanted to present something to Swami Haridas, but the wise Tansena indicated to the emperor not to do so as it would alter Haridas\u2019s mood. The samadhi of this great personality is still present in Nidhivan.\nAfterwards, Akbar asked for the service from Swami Shri Haridas. When he repeatedly requested Swamiji to grant him opportunity to do something for Vrindavan at least, Swamiji said, \"You are so persistent and have such a keen desire, kindly get one of the broken stairs of Yamuna Ghat repaired.\" He directed his disciples to guide King to the broken stair. Akbar was now really disappointed. The thought the sage may be a great musician but seems to be mad at the same time. He is telling me, the King of Hindustan to get a damaged stair repaired? I am the one who have constructed huge forts and mosques and now they are taking me to show the broken stair which I should get repaired? What a joke? But better sense prevailed on him; he kept his cool and followed the saints. As he reached Yamuna bank and the accompanying saint pointed to broken stair, the scene before him changed in a flash. What he was now seeing was not ordinary stone-mortar masonry, but he saw the ghat made up of precious metals (gold and silver) and studded with rare gems. Rubys, diamonds, sapphires, emeralds etc of such high purity and size were studded so generously that it was impossible to estimate the cost. Even then he tried to look at the broken corner and found on comparision with other corner, that he would not be able to get the matching gems for repair even if he was hundred times richer and spent all his fortune for this repair.\nNow he knew the real nature of Swamiji. The scene changed again, now the ghat appeared to be ordinary stone-mortar masonry, but Akbar did not dare to undertake the repairs. Disillusioned, he walked back to Swamiji, bowed to him in dandvat, admitted his incapacity to touch anything in Vrindavan and left for Delhi along with Mian Tansen."

Haridas ji, incarnation of Lalita Sakhi, used to please Shri Bihariji by sweetly singing devotional songs, he had personally composed as he played the vina. While singing, he would become so absorbed that he would forget his body and mind and kept on singing day and night. The famous Baijubavara and Tansena were his disciples. Upon hearing about Swami Haridasa\u2019s glories from the mouth of Tansena, who was the jewel among Emperor. Akbara\u2019s ministers, Akbarahimself desired to relish the nectar of Haridasa\u2019s blissful music. But Swami Haridas had firmly resolved not to entertain anyone but his deity \"Shri Bihariji\". Therefore one day Emperor Akbara disguised himself as an ordinary man and, along with Tansena, came to Swami Haridas\u2019s bhajana kutira in Nidhivan. Tansena, who also was very expert in music, had purposely brought his vina along and now began to sing a sweet song. His singing enchanted Akbara. Swami Haridasa then took the Vina from the hands of Tansena and began to sing the same song, pointing out the errors that Tansena had made in singing it. Swami Haridasa\u2019s singing was so sweet and attractive that even the deer, birds and other animals of the forest came to that spot, where they listened silently. Emperor Akbara\u2019s amazement knew no bounds. He was so pleased that he immediately wanted to present something to Swami Haridas, but the wise Tansena indicated to the emperor not to do so as it would alter Haridas\u2019s mood. The samadhi of this great personality is still present in Nidhivan.\nAfterwards, Akbar asked for the service from Swami Shri Haridas. When he repeatedly requested Swamiji to grant him opportunity to do something for Vrindavan at least, Swamiji said, \"You are so persistent and have such a keen desire, kindly get one of the broken stairs of Yamuna Ghat repaired.\" He directed his disciples to guide King to the broken stair. Akbar was now really disappointed. The thought the sage may be a great musician but seems to be mad at the same time. He is telling me, the King of Hindustan to get a damaged stair repaired? I am the one who have constructed huge forts and mosques and now they are taking me to show the broken stair which I should get repaired? What a joke? But better sense prevailed on him; he kept his cool and followed the saints. As he reached Yamuna bank and the accompanying saint pointed to broken stair, the scene before him changed in a flash. What he was now seeing was not ordinary stone-mortar masonry, but he saw the ghat made up of precious metals (gold and silver) and studded with rare gems. Rubys, diamonds, sapphires, emeralds etc of such high purity and size were studded so generously that it was impossible to estimate the cost. Even then he tried to look at the broken corner and found on comparision with other corner, that he would not be able to get the matching gems for repair even if he was hundred times richer and spent all his fortune for this repair.\nNow he knew the real nature of Swamiji. The scene changed again, now the ghat appeared to be ordinary stone-mortar masonry, but Akbar did not dare to undertake the repairs. Disillusioned, he walked back to Swamiji, bowed to him in dandvat, admitted his incapacity to touch anything in Vrindavan and left for Delhi along with Mian Tansen."

Always meditate on the sweet forms of Radha Krishn alone. According to the principle of the Rasiks, Shymasundar is the servant in the realm of divine love-sports and always pleases Kishori Ji in various ways in the bowers. This divine secret cannot be known by anyone else except the Rasiks. Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji says, Only rasiks, who constantly drink this nectar of divine love, know its sweetness showered in the inner bowers."

She expressed this yearning to Yamuna and requested her help. Krishna's dear Shri Yamuna entreated her beloved Krishna to bestow His mercy upon her elder sister, so when the time was right, Shri Krishna summoned Gangaji to Braj and blessed her by frolicking in her waters."

That's why she offered it to Shyamsundar first so that he will offer first to Radharani to drink. Shyamsundar smiled thinking that Lalita Ji is very clever.\nShyamsunder puts that bowl on the lips of Radharani and Shree Radharani was avoiding and saying \"No you drink it first, Lalita gave it you first\", but Shyamsunder keeps insisted her that \"No you have to drink it first then I will drink it\". Radharani drank it and then Shyamsundar took it as Radha Rani's prasad and then he drank it. This pastime was performed in this place so it is known as Paigaon- Pai means milk, Gaon means Village. Hence the place is known as Paigaon."

That's why she offered it to Shyamsundar first so that he will offer first to Radharani to drink. Shyamsundar smiled thinking that Lalita Ji is very clever.\nShyamsunder puts that bowl on the lips of Radharani and Shree Radharani was avoiding and saying \"No you drink it first, Lalita gave it you first\", but Shyamsunder keeps insisted her that \"No you have to drink it first then I will drink it\". Radharani drank it and then Shyamsundar took it as Radha Rani's prasad and then he drank it. This pastime was performed in this place so it is known as Paigaon- Pai means milk, Gaon means Village. Hence the place is known as Paigaon."

Sakhis are amazed to see their beauty today and one Sakhi tells others that today's beauty is unique from other days. Both of them are looking fresh and youthful. The dark complexion of Shri Krishn and the fair complexion of Radharani are lightening each other. Shri Krishn's chest is adorned with a yellow garment and Radha Rani is dressed in the blue garments and it's like red gold which is decorated with white flowers and the moon in the dark blue sky. The Sakhi\u2019s are amazed to see such a beautiful form of the duo which is indescribable. Swami Shri Hari Das Ji says, There are no words to describe this beauty, which even millions of Rasik Saints cannot describe. The Sakhis are feeling fortunate to have a glimpse of the most blissful Jori which is ever-youthful."

Sakhis are amazed to see their beauty today and one Sakhi tells others that today's beauty is unique from other days. Both of them are looking fresh and youthful. The dark complexion of Shri Krishn and the fair complexion of Radharani are lightening each other. Shri Krishn's chest is adorned with a yellow garment and Radha Rani is dressed in the blue garments and it's like red gold which is decorated with white flowers and the moon in the dark blue sky. The Sakhi\u2019s are amazed to see such a beautiful form of the duo which is indescribable. Swami Shri Hari Das Ji says, There are no words to describe this beauty, which even millions of Rasik Saints cannot describe. The Sakhis are feeling fortunate to have a glimpse of the most blissful Jori which is ever-youthful."

swing pastimes of Radha and Krishna known as jhulana-lila. The word \u2018imli\u2019 means \u2018tamarind\u2019 and \u2018tala\u2019 means \u2018tree\u2019. Once while Roop Goswami was spending some time at Radha-kunda, he came and sat beneath this huge tamarind tree and became deeply absorbed in chanting. The next thing he became aware of was a very nicely decorated swing that he noticed hanging from one of the tree\u2019s branches. The swing, also called a jhula, was designed in such a way that two persons could sit on the swing while facing each other. Then all of a sudden, Roop Goswami saw both Radha and Krishna arrive at the swing accompanied by all their gopi girlfriends. Krishna immediately climbed onto the swing and then invited Radharani to join Him. Radharani at first refused, because Krishna sometimes made this particular swing go far too high, which would always frighten Her. Krishna then promised that He would not to cause the swing go so high and the gopis said that they would themselves push the swing and would not allow it to go so very high. After much persuading, Radharani ultimately agreed to everyone\u2019s repeated requests and sat down on the swing facing Krishna.\nThe gopis then began to gently push the swing backwards and forwards much to the pleasure of everyone. When Krishna saw that Radharani and the gopis were in a happy and relaxed mood while enjoying the jhulana pastimes, He cunningly began to move His legs \u2018to and fro\u2019 in order to make the swing go gradually higher. Within a very short time, and before the gopis could realize what was happening, the swing was going so high there was no way that they could control it. As the swing went even higher, Radharani pleaded with Krishna to stop, but Krishna just smiled sweetly and made the swing go even higher. Suddenly the swing reached such a height that it appeared that it would go a full circle right over the top of the tree branch. At that moment Radharani screamed aloud and leaped forward, throwing Her arms around Krishna\u2019s neck while holding on for dear life. At that moment the swing went a full circle right over the top of the tree branch and came down on the other side. The gopis were amazed to see the swing go right over the top of the branch with Radharani firmly holding on to Krishna\u2019s neck as if Her very life depended on it. When the swing finally slowed down, Radharani was still holding Krishna tightly in Her arms as if She would never let go. The gopis were so overjoyed and ecstatic to see Radharani embracing Krishna with such force, and they all started to laugh and clap their hands, while praising the incredible and uncommon pastimes of the \u2018divine lovers\u2019. At that same moment, having observed all that had happened, as waves of ecstasy flowed through the body and mind of Roop Goswami, he suddenly lost consciousness and fell on the ground. When Roop finally regained his senses, he saw that Radha and Krishna had left with Their friends, but the swing was still there hanging from the tree branch. Then, to his utter amazement, he noticed that the branch holding the swing was completely twisted due to the force of the swing as it went a full circle right over the top and down the other side.\nThis twisted tamarind tree became very famous and every pilgrim who visited Radha-kunda went to have darshana of the Imli Tala. Unfortunately, during the mid-seventies, this tamarind tree eventually died leaving only a stump. Nevertheless, pilgrims still here by go there just to pay their obeisances and remember the incredible swing pastime witnessed by Roop Goswami."

swing pastimes of Radha and Krishna known as jhulana-lila. The word \u2018imli\u2019 means \u2018tamarind\u2019 and \u2018tala\u2019 means \u2018tree\u2019. Once while Roop Goswami was spending some time at Radha-kunda, he came and sat beneath this huge tamarind tree and became deeply absorbed in chanting. The next thing he became aware of was a very nicely decorated swing that he noticed hanging from one of the tree\u2019s branches. The swing, also called a jhula, was designed in such a way that two persons could sit on the swing while facing each other. Then all of a sudden, Roop Goswami saw both Radha and Krishna arrive at the swing accompanied by all their gopi girlfriends. Krishna immediately climbed onto the swing and then invited Radharani to join Him. Radharani at first refused, because Krishna sometimes made this particular swing go far too high, which would always frighten Her. Krishna then promised that He would not to cause the swing go so high and the gopis said that they would themselves push the swing and would not allow it to go so very high. After much persuading, Radharani ultimately agreed to everyone\u2019s repeated requests and sat down on the swing facing Krishna.\nThe gopis then began to gently push the swing backwards and forwards much to the pleasure of everyone. When Krishna saw that Radharani and the gopis were in a happy and relaxed mood while enjoying the jhulana pastimes, He cunningly began to move His legs \u2018to and fro\u2019 in order to make the swing go gradually higher. Within a very short time, and before the gopis could realize what was happening, the swing was going so high there was no way that they could control it. As the swing went even higher, Radharani pleaded with Krishna to stop, but Krishna just smiled sweetly and made the swing go even higher. Suddenly the swing reached such a height that it appeared that it would go a full circle right over the top of the tree branch. At that moment Radharani screamed aloud and leaped forward, throwing Her arms around Krishna\u2019s neck while holding on for dear life. At that moment the swing went a full circle right over the top of the tree branch and came down on the other side. The gopis were amazed to see the swing go right over the top of the branch with Radharani firmly holding on to Krishna\u2019s neck as if Her very life depended on it. When the swing finally slowed down, Radharani was still holding Krishna tightly in Her arms as if She would never let go. The gopis were so overjoyed and ecstatic to see Radharani embracing Krishna with such force, and they all started to laugh and clap their hands, while praising the incredible and uncommon pastimes of the \u2018divine lovers\u2019. At that same moment, having observed all that had happened, as waves of ecstasy flowed through the body and mind of Roop Goswami, he suddenly lost consciousness and fell on the ground. When Roop finally regained his senses, he saw that Radha and Krishna had left with Their friends, but the swing was still there hanging from the tree branch. Then, to his utter amazement, he noticed that the branch holding the swing was completely twisted due to the force of the swing as it went a full circle right over the top and down the other side.\nThis twisted tamarind tree became very famous and every pilgrim who visited Radha-kunda went to have darshana of the Imli Tala. Unfortunately, during the mid-seventies, this tamarind tree eventually died leaving only a stump. Nevertheless, pilgrims still here by go there just to pay their obeisances and remember the incredible swing pastime witnessed by Roop Goswami."

The sakhis took the opportunity to secretly tie the divine couple's cloth together. When Radha and Krishn stood, They found Their cloth was tied together and felt little shy as all the sakhis smiled in great fun. After throwing colored dyes [playing Holi], the sakhis untied Their clothing. For this reason, the town is named Ganthauli. This red color is seen by the people in Vasant [springtime] in the water of Gulal Kund."

The sakhis took the opportunity to secretly tie the divine couple's cloth together. When Radha and Krishn stood, They found Their cloth was tied together and felt little shy as all the sakhis smiled in great fun. After throwing colored dyes [playing Holi], the sakhis untied Their clothing. For this reason, the town is named Ganthauli. This red color is seen by the people in Vasant [springtime] in the water of Gulal Kund."

necessary provisions for making sweet rice in his kutir. At that time, she who brings about the fulfillment of the inner aspiration of devotees, Radha Rani, could understand everything. And so, in the dress of a young gopi girl she brought milk, rice, and sugar to Rupa Goswami, saying, \"Swamiji! Swamiji! I have brought you a gift of uncooked rice. Please accept it. Hearing the words of the young girl, Shri Rupa Goswami opened the door to his hut and looked out. There he saw a beautiful young gopi maiden with some offerings of food. Rupa Goswami said, \"Little girl! Whay have you come here?\"\u00a0\"Swamiji! I have only brought you some simple uncooked food.\"\u00a0\"Why have you taken such trouble for me?\"\u00a0\"Baba! What trouble? I have only come to render a humble service to a saintly person.\"\u00a0Accepting the offering of milk, sugar and uncooked rice, Rupa Goswami said, \"Young girl please take your seat, while I put these things away.\" The girl said, \"I'm sorry, but I have some work to do.\" Saying this, the girl disappeared. When Rupa Goswami turned around and saw that she had gone, he was very bewildered by all this. At length, he prepared the sweet rice and offered the bhoga to his deity, Govindadeva. After some time, he gave the prasada to Sanatana Goswami, who had just arrived. While honoring prasada, Sanatana Goswami experienced an unusual and enchanting kind of joy. He asked Shri Rupa, \"Where did you get this milk and rice from?\" Rupa Goswami said, \"A young gopi girl came by and gave it to me.\" Sanatana said, \"A young girl just came by all of a sudden and gave you this milk and rice?\" Rupa Goswami replied, \"Yes, she just came by all of a sudden. The strange thing is, I was just thinking, 'how can I make some sweet rice for Sanatana,' and she just appeared, as if by magic, with this milk and rice and some sugar.\" hearing this, tears of prema began falling from the eyes of Sanatana Goswami. He said, \"Can't you recognize something when it is right before your eyes? It was Shri Radha Thakurani Herself who has brought you milk and rice. By accepting service from Her we are ruined. Now we shall never attain our desired goal.\" And in this way, Sanatana Goswami out of extreme humbleness continually condemned himself again and again for having accepted service from that person whom he most aspired to serve: Shri Radha Thakurani. This pastime of Shri Sanatana Goswami is recorded in the Bhakti Ratnakara."

necessary provisions for making sweet rice in his kutir. At that time, she who brings about the fulfillment of the inner aspiration of devotees, Radha Rani, could understand everything. And so, in the dress of a young gopi girl she brought milk, rice, and sugar to Rupa Goswami, saying, \"Swamiji! Swamiji! I have brought you a gift of uncooked rice. Please accept it. Hearing the words of the young girl, Shri Rupa Goswami opened the door to his hut and looked out. There he saw a beautiful young gopi maiden with some offerings of food. Rupa Goswami said, \"Little girl! Whay have you come here?\"\u00a0\"Swamiji! I have only brought you some simple uncooked food.\"\u00a0\"Why have you taken such trouble for me?\"\u00a0\"Baba! What trouble? I have only come to render a humble service to a saintly person.\"\u00a0Accepting the offering of milk, sugar and uncooked rice, Rupa Goswami said, \"Young girl please take your seat, while I put these things away.\" The girl said, \"I'm sorry, but I have some work to do.\" Saying this, the girl disappeared. When Rupa Goswami turned around and saw that she had gone, he was very bewildered by all this. At length, he prepared the sweet rice and offered the bhoga to his deity, Govindadeva. After some time, he gave the prasada to Sanatana Goswami, who had just arrived. While honoring prasada, Sanatana Goswami experienced an unusual and enchanting kind of joy. He asked Shri Rupa, \"Where did you get this milk and rice from?\" Rupa Goswami said, \"A young gopi girl came by and gave it to me.\" Sanatana said, \"A young girl just came by all of a sudden and gave you this milk and rice?\" Rupa Goswami replied, \"Yes, she just came by all of a sudden. The strange thing is, I was just thinking, 'how can I make some sweet rice for Sanatana,' and she just appeared, as if by magic, with this milk and rice and some sugar.\" hearing this, tears of prema began falling from the eyes of Sanatana Goswami. He said, \"Can't you recognize something when it is right before your eyes? It was Shri Radha Thakurani Herself who has brought you milk and rice. By accepting service from Her we are ruined. Now we shall never attain our desired goal.\" And in this way, Sanatana Goswami out of extreme humbleness continually condemned himself again and again for having accepted service from that person whom he most aspired to serve: Shri Radha Thakurani. This pastime of Shri Sanatana Goswami is recorded in the Bhakti Ratnakara."

Today let us exchange our Shringaar (adornments). So Both Radha Krishn agreed and exchanged their attire. So Radharani is in Bihariji\u2019s dress and Bihariji is in Radharani\u2019s dress. The sakhis were overjoyed to see such a beautiful sight when Shri Radharani puts flute on her lips and she puts her sidelong glance on Bihariji. So Radharani is Bankebihari and today she welcomed Bihariji (who is in the dress of Radharani) to come out of the Nikunj. They both are enjoying the Keli Leela, and Swami Shri Haridas (Shri Lalita Sakhi\u2019s Avtar) is watching this leela, who was so enchanted by their dance, movements, expressions, and love for each other and prayed from the bottom of his heart that may both of them always remain together and he gave them blessings and good wishes that may Shri Radha Krishn keep on Smiling every moment and says Balihari Balihari."

Today let us exchange our Shringaar (adornments). So Both Radha Krishn agreed and exchanged their attire. So Radharani is in Bihariji\u2019s dress and Bihariji is in Radharani\u2019s dress. The sakhis were overjoyed to see such a beautiful sight when Shri Radharani puts flute on her lips and she puts her sidelong glance on Bihariji. So Radharani is Bankebihari and today she welcomed Bihariji (who is in the dress of Radharani) to come out of the Nikunj. They both are enjoying the Keli Leela, and Swami Shri Haridas (Shri Lalita Sakhi\u2019s Avtar) is watching this leela, who was so enchanted by their dance, movements, expressions, and love for each other and prayed from the bottom of his heart that may both of them always remain together and he gave them blessings and good wishes that may Shri Radha Krishn keep on Smiling every moment and says Balihari Balihari."

Nandgaon is located about 8.5 km to the north of Barsana. Nandgaon is located about 50 Kms on the north west of Mathura.\nLord Shiva pleased his worshipful deity Shri Krishna and asked for the boon to have darshan of his childhood pastimes. Shri Krishn pleased with him and asked him to situate himself in Nandagaon in the form of a hill. Lord Shiva became Nandeshwar Hill at Nandgaon. Nandbaba's Palace is located at Nandeshwar Hill.\nHere, Mother Yashoda, Father Nandbaba and Krishnam Baldev performed many of Their childhood, boyhood and youth pastimes. Every day, Mother Yashoda used to decorate Balrama and Krishna in different ways. Shri Krishn and Balram with Their friends, go to cow grazing daily. Here, Mother Yashoda used to put Radharani on her lap before seeing Her off with tearful eyes."

What can I say about these eyes of mine? These honey bee like eyes have got stuck in the nectar of lotus face of Shree Radha, they have forgotten to go anywhere else. Whenever these eyelids get closed due to Spontaneous blinking of an eye, even then also these eyes become very restlessness and anxious. This nectarine bliss of lotus face of Shri Radharani is so joyous that even a momentary closing of eyes feel as if hundreds of eras have been elapsed in not seeing my blissful Lord.\nShri Harivansh Harivansh Mahaprabhu incarnation of Shri Krishn's Murali says that the eyes of Shree Krishn becomes the ornaments in the ears of Shri Radharani and he himself becomes different ornaments in different parts of lotus face of Radha rani, still, he is not fully satisfied rather his desire to serve is increasing multi folds. That is why Shri Krishn is praying to become the aquatic fish of Shri Radha rani's navel\u2019s bodily lake, such that he can experience no separation and relish nectarine bliss of Shri Radharani ceaselessly, achieving this divinity of becoming Shri Radha\u2019s ornament or her body part, ultimately Lord Krishn will feel blessed."

What can I say about these eyes of mine? These honey bee like eyes have got stuck in the nectar of lotus face of Shree Radha, they have forgotten to go anywhere else. Whenever these eyelids get closed due to Spontaneous blinking of an eye, even then also these eyes become very restlessness and anxious. This nectarine bliss of lotus face of Shri Radharani is so joyous that even a momentary closing of eyes feel as if hundreds of eras have been elapsed in not seeing my blissful Lord.\nShri Harivansh Harivansh Mahaprabhu incarnation of Shri Krishn's Murali says that the eyes of Shree Krishn becomes the ornaments in the ears of Shri Radharani and he himself becomes different ornaments in different parts of lotus face of Radha rani, still, he is not fully satisfied rather his desire to serve is increasing multi folds. That is why Shri Krishn is praying to become the aquatic fish of Shri Radha rani's navel\u2019s bodily lake, such that he can experience no separation and relish nectarine bliss of Shri Radharani ceaselessly, achieving this divinity of becoming Shri Radha\u2019s ornament or her body part, ultimately Lord Krishn will feel blessed."

All attractive Shri Shyam Sundar is effulgent like a blue sapphire and the daughter of Shri Vrishbhanu, Shri Radha is golden complexioned. The divine forehead of Shri Krishn is glorified with distinctive Tilak mark (his forehead is adorned by the mark of bright saffron), whereas beloved Radha rani has charming vermillion in her parting line of head. The walking style of Shri Krishn is most similar to that of the elephant, which is so captivating and Shri Radharani\u2019s extraordinary style of walking is similar to that of an intoxicated elephant as well. Shri Radha wears attractive blue garments and Shri Krishn wears attractive yellow garments. Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu says, the beauty and bliss of this divine couple is limitless. Shri Krishn, the beloved one of Radha, is actually the crest jewel of all Rasiks and Shri Radha is never ending ocean of the blissful divine beauty who provides ceaseless bliss to the Rasiks."

Goswami thought, \u201cIn order to fulfill the innermost heart\u2019s desire of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, I will write a drama. In this drama I will explain the beauty of the union of Shri Radha and Sri Krishna in Vrindavan, and also Their separation pastimes, when Lord Krishna leaves Vrindavan and goes to Mathura and Dwarka.\"\nHe intended to write about this, but while he was traveling towards Jagannath Puri, then Satyabhama-devi, Lord Krishna\u2019s chief queen, appeared to him in a dream and told him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t make only one drama. Please divide it into two parts.\u201d\nThen, when Srila Roop Goswami finally arrived at Jagannatha Puri and met with Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, He confirmed what he had heard from Srimati Satyabhama in his dream. Sriman Mahaprabhu told him, \u201cDon\u2019t take Sri Krishna out of Vrindavan.\u201d\nChaitanya-charitamrita (Antya 1.67):\nkrishno \u2019nyo yadu-sambhuto\nyah purnah so \u2019sty atah parah\nvrindavanam parityajya\nsa kvachin naiva gachchati\nLord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu told Rupa Goswami. \u201cThe Krishna known as Yadukumara is Vasudeva Krishna. He is different from the Krishna who is the son of Nanda Maharaja. Yadukumara Krishna manifests his pastimes in the cities of Mathura and Dwaraka, but Krishna, the son of Nanda Maharaja never leaves Vrindavan at any cost. He never takes an inch of step outside Vrindavan.\u201d\nShri Krishna, the one who is soul beloved of Radha, he never goes out of Vrindavan, however, this mystery is known to very few people only. To give supreme pleasure to His loving associates and even to relish His own wonderful pastimes, Sri Krishna manifested in Vrindavan in his pure Madhurya form with Radharani. Therefore Rasik Saints of Vrindavan used to recite: \"Humaro Murali Waaro Shyam\" (The flute holder Krishna is ours only). The flute holder Krishna is only our, all in all, we don't want or try to know much about Krishna of Mathura or Dwarka."

Goswami thought, \u201cIn order to fulfill the innermost heart\u2019s desire of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, I will write a drama. In this drama I will explain the beauty of the union of Shri Radha and Sri Krishna in Vrindavan, and also Their separation pastimes, when Lord Krishna leaves Vrindavan and goes to Mathura and Dwarka.\"\nHe intended to write about this, but while he was traveling towards Jagannath Puri, then Satyabhama-devi, Lord Krishna\u2019s chief queen, appeared to him in a dream and told him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t make only one drama. Please divide it into two parts.\u201d\nThen, when Srila Roop Goswami finally arrived at Jagannatha Puri and met with Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, He confirmed what he had heard from Srimati Satyabhama in his dream. Sriman Mahaprabhu told him, \u201cDon\u2019t take Sri Krishna out of Vrindavan.\u201d\nChaitanya-charitamrita (Antya 1.67):\nkrishno \u2019nyo yadu-sambhuto\nyah purnah so \u2019sty atah parah\nvrindavanam parityajya\nsa kvachin naiva gachchati\nLord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu told Rupa Goswami. \u201cThe Krishna known as Yadukumara is Vasudeva Krishna. He is different from the Krishna who is the son of Nanda Maharaja. Yadukumara Krishna manifests his pastimes in the cities of Mathura and Dwaraka, but Krishna, the son of Nanda Maharaja never leaves Vrindavan at any cost. He never takes an inch of step outside Vrindavan.\u201d\nShri Krishna, the one who is soul beloved of Radha, he never goes out of Vrindavan, however, this mystery is known to very few people only. To give supreme pleasure to His loving associates and even to relish His own wonderful pastimes, Sri Krishna manifested in Vrindavan in his pure Madhurya form with Radharani. Therefore Rasik Saints of Vrindavan used to recite: \"Humaro Murali Waaro Shyam\" (The flute holder Krishna is ours only). The flute holder Krishna is only our, all in all, we don't want or try to know much about Krishna of Mathura or Dwarka."

The pair looks like the golden vines (Shri Radha) are beautifully adorned (or embracing) in the Tamal Tree (Shyam Sundar). Shri Haripriya Sehchari prays that \"the Divine couple who is the essence of joy, beauty, and nectar must always reside in my heart in this very form\"."

His samadhi suddenly disturbed. Immediately he came to Vrindavan where the night of Maha Raas had arrived. Shankar Ji came to Vrindavan to enter in the Maharas, but stopped at the gate of Maha Raas. Extremely beautiful Braj Gopis and Vrinda Devi stopped Shri Shankar (Best among the Vaishnavas) saying: \u201cIn this private Raas Mandal, No males except Krishna are allowed entry.\u201d The spirit of Rasa is to please Raseshwari Shri Radha as a sakhi (friend) so as to maximize the bliss or Rasa Ras. Lord Shiv was left with no option but to sit at the entry point of Vrindavan and watching the magnificent Leela of Divinity Determined as he was, Lord Shiv meditated intensely on Raseshwari Shri Radhey Herself seeking her grace. Knowing His determination Radha Rani, the merciful universal Mother, dispatched her confident Lalita to initiate Shiv in Sakhibhav. Lalita Devi said if you desire to enjoy the Maha Raas then he should take the shelter of Shri Radha Rani, bathe in the Mansarovar, only then you can enter. Following the footsteps of her, On taking the dip, Shiv emerged as a young charming gopi, by the Grace of Radha Rani, he attained the form of a beautiful \"Shivani Gopi\" quickly and then he entered the Maha Raas. During the MahaRaas, Shri Krishna enquired about the new Gopi. Lord Krishna asked Lalita Devi to bring her to Him. When the Lord Krishn saw Lord Shiva as \"Shivani\" gopi, He laughed heartily and addressed him: \"O Gopeshwar, I am very pleased to see you in the form of a gopi. Therefore, since you have already participated and fulfilled your desire, now I offer you the post of Raas Dwaar Paal (Gatekeeper of the Maha Raas). I also give you the blessing that henceforth, all the gopis will offer respect to you and seek your blessing to get Gopi Bhava. Even today, Shri Gopeshwar Mahadev gives boon to the sadhaks to achieve the top most bliss of Vrindavan and bless the sadhaks. Since then, Lord Shiva as Gopeshwar Mahadev lives in the Nikunja at the bank of Yamuna River near Vanshi Vata as four main Rasik Mahadevs of Braj forever and gives boon to all the devotees to achieve Gopi Bhava. Srila Sanatana Gosvami, who resided in Vrndavana near the old Sri Madana-Mohana temple, would go daily to see Sri Gopeshwar Mahadeva at his temple. All Glories to Gopeshwar Mahadev. All Glories to Shri Radha Krishna.\nLocation:\nLord Shiv is worshipped as Gopeshwar Mahadev in Vrindavan. The temple is situated near Vamshivat in Vrindavan and at the Bank of Yamuna River."

His samadhi suddenly disturbed. Immediately he came to Vrindavan where the night of Maha Raas had arrived. Shankar Ji came to Vrindavan to enter in the Maharas, but stopped at the gate of Maha Raas. Extremely beautiful Braj Gopis and Vrinda Devi stopped Shri Shankar (Best among the Vaishnavas) saying: \u201cIn this private Raas Mandal, No males except Krishna are allowed entry.\u201d The spirit of Rasa is to please Raseshwari Shri Radha as a sakhi (friend) so as to maximize the bliss or Rasa Ras. Lord Shiv was left with no option but to sit at the entry point of Vrindavan and watching the magnificent Leela of Divinity Determined as he was, Lord Shiv meditated intensely on Raseshwari Shri Radhey Herself seeking her grace. Knowing His determination Radha Rani, the merciful universal Mother, dispatched her confident Lalita to initiate Shiv in Sakhibhav. Lalita Devi said if you desire to enjoy the Maha Raas then he should take the shelter of Shri Radha Rani, bathe in the Mansarovar, only then you can enter. Following the footsteps of her, On taking the dip, Shiv emerged as a young charming gopi, by the Grace of Radha Rani, he attained the form of a beautiful \"Shivani Gopi\" quickly and then he entered the Maha Raas. During the MahaRaas, Shri Krishna enquired about the new Gopi. Lord Krishna asked Lalita Devi to bring her to Him. When the Lord Krishn saw Lord Shiva as \"Shivani\" gopi, He laughed heartily and addressed him: \"O Gopeshwar, I am very pleased to see you in the form of a gopi. Therefore, since you have already participated and fulfilled your desire, now I offer you the post of Raas Dwaar Paal (Gatekeeper of the Maha Raas). I also give you the blessing that henceforth, all the gopis will offer respect to you and seek your blessing to get Gopi Bhava. Even today, Shri Gopeshwar Mahadev gives boon to the sadhaks to achieve the top most bliss of Vrindavan and bless the sadhaks. Since then, Lord Shiva as Gopeshwar Mahadev lives in the Nikunja at the bank of Yamuna River near Vanshi Vata as four main Rasik Mahadevs of Braj forever and gives boon to all the devotees to achieve Gopi Bhava. Srila Sanatana Gosvami, who resided in Vrndavana near the old Sri Madana-Mohana temple, would go daily to see Sri Gopeshwar Mahadeva at his temple. All Glories to Gopeshwar Mahadev. All Glories to Shri Radha Krishna.\nLocation:\nLord Shiv is worshipped as Gopeshwar Mahadev in Vrindavan. The temple is situated near Vamshivat in Vrindavan and at the Bank of Yamuna River."

was the Chief Minister of Badshah. He was a great soul and generous. The couple didn't have any child and were extremely unhappy even after having huge property. Even after doing many diligence, donations, virtues, devotional ceremonies, and Yantra-Mantras, they didn't get any child and the hope is also vanished. Seeing the King's displeasure, his dear friend and Proficient Minister Shri Chaturbhujdas Ji Goud consoled the king and said that like you, I too became very sad after trying many resources for the son. One day, suddenly I departed to Vrindavan. Seeing the saint Shiromani Shri Swami Haridas Ji Maharaj there, my heart was very happy and thought that \"O Swami Ji, if you know my heart's desire then please give me a son.\nOn seeing me, Swami Ji called me near and said - You are depressed without any son. You will have two sons full of devotion, knowledge, and disinterest. They will stay with you for eighteen years, then they will come to me.\nThen I told him - O compassionate! please give me one child and another one to my friend. He is very sad without a son.\nThen he appreciated the friendly spirit and preached the true friend sentiment and said - first you will have a son here. After five years, you should tell this story to your friend. He should come here with his wife then he will get a son.\nNow that auspicious occasion has come. You have to get darshan of Rasik Ananya Nripati Shri Swami Haridas Ji Maharaj.\nListening to Shri Chaturbhuj Das Ji, the body and mind of Mitrasen were filled with joy, as if the soul returned again to the body. He came to Nidhuvan with great devotion from his heart to visit Shri Swami Haridas Ji Maharaj. He prostrated and put hundred gold coins in the lotus feet of Shri Swami Ji with love, Shri Swami Ji Maharaj was pleased to see him. With folded hands, Mitrasen said - By the mercy of Chaturbhuj Das, I had darshan of you, and now my birth and life succeeded. According to your command, I have come to your shelter.\nShri Swami Ji Maharaj said - Well done that you came here. Now you couple stay in Mathura and one day, you will definitely get a son. Take these gold coins and serve saints with all your heart. When the son is one year old, then bring him here.\nA year later, Shri Biharinidas appeared as an idol of devotion, knowledge, disinterest, and love of Yugal Shri Nitya-Vihari. Mitrasen and Chaturbhuj Das were overjoyed to hear. Donated a lot of money and served the saints in pleasure. After a year, they came to Nidhuvan and bowed down to Shri Swami Ji Maharaj and placed the baby to the lotus feet.\nShri Swami Ji Maharaj saw the beauty of the child and smiled knowing him to be his successor, said - This child is very fortunate. He will remain with you for thirty-three years, then he will come to me and will take renunciation. Know him a one in millions. Then Shri Swami Ji Maharaj blessed the child with Neck Kanthi, Tilak, Prasadi, and cloths and named him Biharinidas.\nThe parents took charnamrit of Shri Swami Ji and sprinkled on the head of the child. The boy walked on his knees and caught the Karuva (small earthen pot) of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj. Shri Swami Ji Maharaj said softly - not now Biharinidas, come later and take it.\nStaying for seven days in Vrindavan, Mitrasen returned to Delhi with his friend seeking permission from Shri Swami Ji Maharaj. The couple began to remain engrossed in joy by seeing their child.\nAfter the demise of his father, Shri Bihari Das was appointed in the Government Service. But his mind was not in peace during his service. Soon after the last rites, of his father, his innate devotion prevailed and his mind became tired of worldly affairs and he dreamt of surrendering his life to Radha Krishn and doing devotion at Vrindavan in complete detachment. He kept on thinking about residing in Vrindavan. He writes as:\n\"\u092c\u0938\u0940 \u0935\u0943\u0902\u0926\u093e\u0935\u0928 \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e \u0920\u093e\u090a\u0901, \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0938\u0902\u0917\u0924\u093f \u092a\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0925 \u092a\u093e\u090a\u0902 |\n\u0928\u093f\u0924 \u0926\u0902\u092a\u0924\u093f \u0938\u0902\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0926\u093f\u0916\u093e\u090a\u0902, \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u092d\u0908 \u0917\u0941\u0928 \u0917\u093e\u090a\u0902 ||\"\nSpiritual Life:\nWhen Biharinidas grew up, he used to imitate the character of Sri Yugal-Leela or the character of Rasik Mahipati Shri Swami Ji Maharaj in playing with friends. He used to preach to the children about the form of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj. He used to chant Shri Haridas's name with meditation and preach the same to others. Shri Krishnadas was six years older than Biharinidas, son of Shri Chaturbhujadas Ji. He was also born by the grace of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj and he named him Krishnadas. He used to be covered in the love-color of Nityavihara day and night. He was very much in love with Biharinidas, as if they had two bodies and one soul. Both of them were immersed in the sweet conversation of Shri Yugal and of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj.\nIn spite of having favorable luxury and wealth of gross happiness, Shri Biharinidas Ji seemed to have a disinterest in the worldly luxuries. His heart was inhabited by the lotus feet of Shri Swami Haridas. Continuously, chanting the name of Shri Haridas and pagination in the color of Nitya Vihar was the nature of his body, mind, and soul. And with association with Shri Krishna Das, he was immersed in Nitya Vihar day and night.\nOne day Shri Krishnadas Ji felt fervent disinterest. He said to Shri Biharinidas Ji - This body is now twenty-one years old. Till now, I am untouched from the effect of this kali yuga by the grace of Guru Maharaj, if I get into bad association now, then my life will be ruined. That is why I will now go to Shri Vrindavan in the shelter of Shri Guru Shri Swami Ji Maharaj. He will bless me and make me the ultimate deviant of devotion, prudence, and continual prosperity, when will such a rare auspicious occasion be accessible?\nShri Biharinidas Ji said - You are supreme flawless, Vairagya Shiromani and purely blessed. Immediately go to Shri Vrindavan. I too will come soon and take refuge of the lotus feet\u00a0 Shri Guru Maharaj. Saying this, Shri Biharinidas greeted him. Shri Krishnadas Ji immediately came to Shri Vrindavan and was happy to find shelter in the lotus feet of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj.\nSeeing the pure love of Shri Krishnadas Ji, Shri Swami Ji Maharaj held his hand in the hands of Shri Vithalvipuldev Ji and said - he is a body part of mine. Take him in your shelter.\nShri Vithalvipuladev obeyed and made Shri Krishnadas Ji the ultimate bright righteous follower, preached him the path of Shri Haridas, drenched him in Nityavihar essence.\nHere, Shri Biharinidas Ji, with the qualities of beauty, modesty, etc., was loved by everyone but still untouched by worldly affairs. In fifteen years of age, his beauty, glory, and youth grew, yet he was free from desire, anger, greed, and attachment. With love and devotion, he used to chant the name of Shri Haridas and the Yugal's mantra. The discrete discussion was not pleasant for him. He was very generous, benevolent, true, brave, patient, and humble in nature.\nWhen his father King Mitrasen left the body, Shah handed him the post of Chief Minister. Shah used to respect him very much after listening to his quality from his Minister Shri Chaturbhuj Das.\nVrindavan Arrival:\nHe once went to war on behalf of Shah. There, their comrades betrayed with the rival on the pretext of the treaty and poisoned the secretary. Due to this, Biharinidas suffered a lot. After cutting his right hand, which had given life blessings to the enemy secretary, and donating the entire splendor, started walking to Shri Vrindavan, then the enemy secretary Kamalapati-sons Nanakaram and Shuklabardhar came in front of him and prayed for self-defense and welfare. Then you said - believe in my word. Keep the body of your deceased father and my hand together. In fifteen days my hand will appear and your father will be alive. All this was the act of time - abandon the sorrow and confusion from the heart, saying this, he walks to Vrindavan. Arriving at Vrindavan, after bowing down to Shri Swami Ji Maharaj, the severed hand came out again. Shri Swami Ji Maharaj put his lotus hand on the head of Biharinidas and blessed him, as if holding the moon on his forehead and assuming the form of Lalita Sakhi, and providing the Sakhi form with the right to serve Shri Radha Krishna in Nitya Nikunj.

His life and his words were very high quality and very firm. He followed a high ideal of Rasik-exclusive path and was a very great Rasik of high caliber. His words were the expansions of the Vani of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj, which is deep, succulent, and is attractive for the followers of this path.\nHe gave up all his worldly desires. With the grace of the dust of Vrindavan, his mind got a very deep attachment in the feet of Shri Radharani and finally, he never looked back to the world.\nIt was as if his heart was drenched in Shri Radharani\u2019s (Swaminiji\u2019s) seva, where he writes in his poems:\n\u201c \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u0948 \u0935\u093f\u0938\u0928 \u0935\u0930 \u0935\u093e\u092e, \u0924\u0928 \u0917\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0928 \u092d\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u0928\u0935\u0932 \u0915\u093f\u0936\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u0927\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e |\n\u0928\u093f\u0938 \u092c\u093e\u0938\u0930 \u091c\u093e\u0917\u0924 \u0938\u094b\u0935\u0924 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u0935\u0924 \u0905\u0902\u0917 \u0905\u0902\u0917 \u0905\u092d\u093f\u0930\u093e\u092e |\n\u0905\u0902\u091c\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u091c\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u093e\u0924 \u092a\u0930\u092e \u0930\u0942\u091a\u093f \u091a\u094b\u092a \u091a\u094c\u0917\u0941\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u093e\u092e ||\n\u0924\u093e\u0915\u093f \u0939\u093f\u0932\u0917\u0940 \u0924\u091c\u0948 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0927\u0928 \u0927\u093e\u092e |\n\u0926\u0908 \u092a\u0940\u0920\u093f \u0938\u092c \u091c\u0917\u0924\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u0917\u0924\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u093e\u092f\u094b \u092c\u0928 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e ||\"\nAs soon as he took Shelter in the feet of Shri Radharani, by residing in Vrindavan and giving up the material desires, His fickle mind has finally got the ultimate rest and relief.\nHe became totally dependent upon Brajwasis (residents of Braj) for food. This way he started living renounced life by begging food from them. He described it as:\n\"\u0930\u0941\u091a\u0947 \u092e\u094b\u0939\u093f \u092c\u094d\u0930\u091c\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u091f\u0942\u0915\"\nHe has expressed his unique loyalty to Braj Dham and Brajwasis. In one pada, he has not hesitated to tell himself the pet of Brajwasis.\n\"\u0939\u094c\u0902 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u091c\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u0928 \u0915\u094c \u092a\u093e\u0932\u094d\u092f\u094b \u092a\u0940\u0932\u093e\"\nNow with the passing time, He became totally lost in the Nitya Vihar Ras. There is a very famous incidence related to his life. Once, while going for a bath in the Yamuna, he had dantun (brush) in his mouth. He remained standing on the road for three days, remained absorbed in divine bliss singing a certain verse:\n\u201cViharat Laal Viharin Dou, Shri Yamuna ke Teere Teere\"\n(Yugal Sarkar (Radha & Krishna) are performing leelas and are passing at the bank of Yamuna).\nAfter eating Prasad of Bihariji, he gained back consciousness. It is said that after this incidence, He gave up the Prakat (physical) Bihariji Sewa and remain absorbed in Mansik (Mind) Sewa.\nHe writes this way saying, some get intoxicated with drugs, but Biharin Das is always intoxicated in the divine bliss of Shree Shyama Shyam.\n\"\u0915\u094b\u090a \u092e\u0926\u092e\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u092d\u093e\u0902\u0917 \u0915\u0947, \u0915\u094b\u0909 \u0905\u092e\u0932 \u0905\u092b\u0940\u092e,\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0926\u093e\u0938 \u0930\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0927\u0941\u0930\u0940, \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0924 \u092e\u0941\u0926\u093f\u0924 \u0924\u094b\u092b\u0940\u092e\u201d\nAfter few days, Swami Sri Haridas Ji entered Nikunj Leela, 7 days after his departure, Vithal Vipul Dev Ji also entered Nikunja. After that Viharin Dev Ji became the Acharya. Shri Biharin Dev Ji remained Acharya of the sect for a long time.\nCompositions:\nHis compositions has two parts - one is the principal aspect, the other is the aspect of the Rasa (Nectar). The composition of Rasa is a reflection of his experience. The way he felt while living as a part of Shri Lalita Ji in a sarcastic form, the experience of inner heart came out as the voice of the Rasa, which the curious followers and Rasik saints drink and feel the nectar of Nitya Vihar Rasa. He himself has said -\n\u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f \u0905\u0927\u0930 \u0938\u0941\u0927\u093e \u092e\u0939\u093e \u092e\u0927\u0941 \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0924 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093f \u0915\u094c\u0924\u0941\u0915 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u094c\u0964\n\u0915\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u0915\u094c \u0938\u0941\u0916 \u0905\u0932\u094d\u092a \u0938\u0916\u093f \u0938\u0941\u0928\u093f \u0915\u0939\u094d\u092f\u094c \u092d\u0930\u093f \u0909\u092e\u0901\u0917\u094d\u092f\u094c \u0939\u093f\u092f\u094c\u0965\nHis compositions are very different for a normal sadhak\u2019s (spiritual aspirant) understanding. He was indulged in this pure happiness where the seeker and the master are so united that now the master considers his seekers equal to himself or rather higher than himself, and, seeker keeps on giving selflessly without actually seeking anything from his master. Because of his continuous thought for his master\u2019s happiness alone, he seeks blessings for his master's happiness only. That is how he narrates in his padas related to Shyama Shyam. Therefore He gives blessings to the pair of Radha Krishn.\n\"\u0926\u0947\u0924 \u0906\u0938\u0940\u0938 \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0928\u093f \u0926\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0939\u0941\u0902 \u0928\u0935\u0932 \u0928\u093f\u0924 \u0930\u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u201c\nHe even says, due to his immense love for Kishori Ji, Shri Radharani, he doesn\u2019t mind Bihariji, which he describes in the lines:\n\"\u0915\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u0930\u0939\u0948 \u0910\u0902\u0921 \u092c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0939\u0942\u0901 \u0938\u094c\u0902, \u0939\u092e \u092c\u0947\u092a\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0939 \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0928\u093f \u0915\u0947\u201c\nThis says as Since we belong to Shri Radha, So we are fearless from everyone including Shri Krishn.\nSwami Shri Biharin Dev Ji entered Nikunja around 1670. His samadhi is still in Nidhivan. In his disciple tradition, Swami Shri Nagaridas Ji and Shri Saras Das were his main followers."

was the Chief Minister of Badshah. He was a great soul and generous. The couple didn't have any child and were extremely unhappy even after having huge property. Even after doing many diligence, donations, virtues, devotional ceremonies, and Yantra-Mantras, they didn't get any child and the hope is also vanished. Seeing the King's displeasure, his dear friend and Proficient Minister Shri Chaturbhujdas Ji Goud consoled the king and said that like you, I too became very sad after trying many resources for the son. One day, suddenly I departed to Vrindavan. Seeing the saint Shiromani Shri Swami Haridas Ji Maharaj there, my heart was very happy and thought that \"O Swami Ji, if you know my heart's desire then please give me a son.\nOn seeing me, Swami Ji called me near and said - You are depressed without any son. You will have two sons full of devotion, knowledge, and disinterest. They will stay with you for eighteen years, then they will come to me.\nThen I told him - O compassionate! please give me one child and another one to my friend. He is very sad without a son.\nThen he appreciated the friendly spirit and preached the true friend sentiment and said - first you will have a son here. After five years, you should tell this story to your friend. He should come here with his wife then he will get a son.\nNow that auspicious occasion has come. You have to get darshan of Rasik Ananya Nripati Shri Swami Haridas Ji Maharaj.\nListening to Shri Chaturbhuj Das Ji, the body and mind of Mitrasen were filled with joy, as if the soul returned again to the body. He came to Nidhuvan with great devotion from his heart to visit Shri Swami Haridas Ji Maharaj. He prostrated and put hundred gold coins in the lotus feet of Shri Swami Ji with love, Shri Swami Ji Maharaj was pleased to see him. With folded hands, Mitrasen said - By the mercy of Chaturbhuj Das, I had darshan of you, and now my birth and life succeeded. According to your command, I have come to your shelter.\nShri Swami Ji Maharaj said - Well done that you came here. Now you couple stay in Mathura and one day, you will definitely get a son. Take these gold coins and serve saints with all your heart. When the son is one year old, then bring him here.\nA year later, Shri Biharinidas appeared as an idol of devotion, knowledge, disinterest, and love of Yugal Shri Nitya-Vihari. Mitrasen and Chaturbhuj Das were overjoyed to hear. Donated a lot of money and served the saints in pleasure. After a year, they came to Nidhuvan and bowed down to Shri Swami Ji Maharaj and placed the baby to the lotus feet.\nShri Swami Ji Maharaj saw the beauty of the child and smiled knowing him to be his successor, said - This child is very fortunate. He will remain with you for thirty-three years, then he will come to me and will take renunciation. Know him a one in millions. Then Shri Swami Ji Maharaj blessed the child with Neck Kanthi, Tilak, Prasadi, and cloths and named him Biharinidas.\nThe parents took charnamrit of Shri Swami Ji and sprinkled on the head of the child. The boy walked on his knees and caught the Karuva (small earthen pot) of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj. Shri Swami Ji Maharaj said softly - not now Biharinidas, come later and take it.\nStaying for seven days in Vrindavan, Mitrasen returned to Delhi with his friend seeking permission from Shri Swami Ji Maharaj. The couple began to remain engrossed in joy by seeing their child.\nAfter the demise of his father, Shri Bihari Das was appointed in the Government Service. But his mind was not in peace during his service. Soon after the last rites, of his father, his innate devotion prevailed and his mind became tired of worldly affairs and he dreamt of surrendering his life to Radha Krishn and doing devotion at Vrindavan in complete detachment. He kept on thinking about residing in Vrindavan. He writes as:\n\"\u092c\u0938\u0940 \u0935\u0943\u0902\u0926\u093e\u0935\u0928 \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e \u0920\u093e\u090a\u0901, \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0938\u0902\u0917\u0924\u093f \u092a\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0925 \u092a\u093e\u090a\u0902 |\n\u0928\u093f\u0924 \u0926\u0902\u092a\u0924\u093f \u0938\u0902\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0926\u093f\u0916\u093e\u090a\u0902, \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u092d\u0908 \u0917\u0941\u0928 \u0917\u093e\u090a\u0902 ||\"\nSpiritual Life:\nWhen Biharinidas grew up, he used to imitate the character of Sri Yugal-Leela or the character of Rasik Mahipati Shri Swami Ji Maharaj in playing with friends. He used to preach to the children about the form of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj. He used to chant Shri Haridas's name with meditation and preach the same to others. Shri Krishnadas was six years older than Biharinidas, son of Shri Chaturbhujadas Ji. He was also born by the grace of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj and he named him Krishnadas. He used to be covered in the love-color of Nityavihara day and night. He was very much in love with Biharinidas, as if they had two bodies and one soul. Both of them were immersed in the sweet conversation of Shri Yugal and of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj.\nIn spite of having favorable luxury and wealth of gross happiness, Shri Biharinidas Ji seemed to have a disinterest in the worldly luxuries. His heart was inhabited by the lotus feet of Shri Swami Haridas. Continuously, chanting the name of Shri Haridas and pagination in the color of Nitya Vihar was the nature of his body, mind, and soul. And with association with Shri Krishna Das, he was immersed in Nitya Vihar day and night.\nOne day Shri Krishnadas Ji felt fervent disinterest. He said to Shri Biharinidas Ji - This body is now twenty-one years old. Till now, I am untouched from the effect of this kali yuga by the grace of Guru Maharaj, if I get into bad association now, then my life will be ruined. That is why I will now go to Shri Vrindavan in the shelter of Shri Guru Shri Swami Ji Maharaj. He will bless me and make me the ultimate deviant of devotion, prudence, and continual prosperity, when will such a rare auspicious occasion be accessible?\nShri Biharinidas Ji said - You are supreme flawless, Vairagya Shiromani and purely blessed. Immediately go to Shri Vrindavan. I too will come soon and take refuge of the lotus feet\u00a0 Shri Guru Maharaj. Saying this, Shri Biharinidas greeted him. Shri Krishnadas Ji immediately came to Shri Vrindavan and was happy to find shelter in the lotus feet of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj.\nSeeing the pure love of Shri Krishnadas Ji, Shri Swami Ji Maharaj held his hand in the hands of Shri Vithalvipuldev Ji and said - he is a body part of mine. Take him in your shelter.\nShri Vithalvipuladev obeyed and made Shri Krishnadas Ji the ultimate bright righteous follower, preached him the path of Shri Haridas, drenched him in Nityavihar essence.\nHere, Shri Biharinidas Ji, with the qualities of beauty, modesty, etc., was loved by everyone but still untouched by worldly affairs. In fifteen years of age, his beauty, glory, and youth grew, yet he was free from desire, anger, greed, and attachment. With love and devotion, he used to chant the name of Shri Haridas and the Yugal's mantra. The discrete discussion was not pleasant for him. He was very generous, benevolent, true, brave, patient, and humble in nature.\nWhen his father King Mitrasen left the body, Shah handed him the post of Chief Minister. Shah used to respect him very much after listening to his quality from his Minister Shri Chaturbhuj Das.\nVrindavan Arrival:\nHe once went to war on behalf of Shah. There, their comrades betrayed with the rival on the pretext of the treaty and poisoned the secretary. Due to this, Biharinidas suffered a lot. After cutting his right hand, which had given life blessings to the enemy secretary, and donating the entire splendor, started walking to Shri Vrindavan, then the enemy secretary Kamalapati-sons Nanakaram and Shuklabardhar came in front of him and prayed for self-defense and welfare. Then you said - believe in my word. Keep the body of your deceased father and my hand together. In fifteen days my hand will appear and your father will be alive. All this was the act of time - abandon the sorrow and confusion from the heart, saying this, he walks to Vrindavan. Arriving at Vrindavan, after bowing down to Shri Swami Ji Maharaj, the severed hand came out again. Shri Swami Ji Maharaj put his lotus hand on the head of Biharinidas and blessed him, as if holding the moon on his forehead and assuming the form of Lalita Sakhi, and providing the Sakhi form with the right to serve Shri Radha Krishna in Nitya Nikunj.

His life and his words were very high quality and very firm. He followed a high ideal of Rasik-exclusive path and was a very great Rasik of high caliber. His words were the expansions of the Vani of Shri Swami Ji Maharaj, which is deep, succulent, and is attractive for the followers of this path.\nHe gave up all his worldly desires. With the grace of the dust of Vrindavan, his mind got a very deep attachment in the feet of Shri Radharani and finally, he never looked back to the world.\nIt was as if his heart was drenched in Shri Radharani\u2019s (Swaminiji\u2019s) seva, where he writes in his poems:\n\u201c \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0937\u0948 \u0935\u093f\u0938\u0928 \u0935\u0930 \u0935\u093e\u092e, \u0924\u0928 \u0917\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0928 \u092d\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u0928\u0935\u0932 \u0915\u093f\u0936\u094b\u0930\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u0927\u093e \u0928\u093e\u092e |\n\u0928\u093f\u0938 \u092c\u093e\u0938\u0930 \u091c\u093e\u0917\u0924 \u0938\u094b\u0935\u0924 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u0935\u0924 \u0905\u0902\u0917 \u0905\u0902\u0917 \u0905\u092d\u093f\u0930\u093e\u092e |\n\u0905\u0902\u091c\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u091c\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u093e\u0924 \u092a\u0930\u092e \u0930\u0942\u091a\u093f \u091a\u094b\u092a \u091a\u094c\u0917\u0941\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u093e\u092e ||\n\u0924\u093e\u0915\u093f \u0939\u093f\u0932\u0917\u0940 \u0924\u091c\u0948 \u092e\u0948\u0902 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0927\u0928 \u0927\u093e\u092e |\n\u0926\u0908 \u092a\u0940\u0920\u093f \u0938\u092c \u091c\u0917\u0924\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u0917\u0924\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u093e\u092f\u094b \u092c\u0928 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e ||\"\nAs soon as he took Shelter in the feet of Shri Radharani, by residing in Vrindavan and giving up the material desires, His fickle mind has finally got the ultimate rest and relief.\nHe became totally dependent upon Brajwasis (residents of Braj) for food. This way he started living renounced life by begging food from them. He described it as:\n\"\u0930\u0941\u091a\u0947 \u092e\u094b\u0939\u093f \u092c\u094d\u0930\u091c\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u091f\u0942\u0915\"\nHe has expressed his unique loyalty to Braj Dham and Brajwasis. In one pada, he has not hesitated to tell himself the pet of Brajwasis.\n\"\u0939\u094c\u0902 \u092c\u094d\u0930\u091c\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f\u0928 \u0915\u094c \u092a\u093e\u0932\u094d\u092f\u094b \u092a\u0940\u0932\u093e\"\nNow with the passing time, He became totally lost in the Nitya Vihar Ras. There is a very famous incidence related to his life. Once, while going for a bath in the Yamuna, he had dantun (brush) in his mouth. He remained standing on the road for three days, remained absorbed in divine bliss singing a certain verse:\n\u201cViharat Laal Viharin Dou, Shri Yamuna ke Teere Teere\"\n(Yugal Sarkar (Radha & Krishna) are performing leelas and are passing at the bank of Yamuna).\nAfter eating Prasad of Bihariji, he gained back consciousness. It is said that after this incidence, He gave up the Prakat (physical) Bihariji Sewa and remain absorbed in Mansik (Mind) Sewa.\nHe writes this way saying, some get intoxicated with drugs, but Biharin Das is always intoxicated in the divine bliss of Shree Shyama Shyam.\n\"\u0915\u094b\u090a \u092e\u0926\u092e\u093e\u0924\u0947 \u092d\u093e\u0902\u0917 \u0915\u0947, \u0915\u094b\u0909 \u0905\u092e\u0932 \u0905\u092b\u0940\u092e,\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u092c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0926\u093e\u0938 \u0930\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0927\u0941\u0930\u0940, \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0924 \u092e\u0941\u0926\u093f\u0924 \u0924\u094b\u092b\u0940\u092e\u201d\nAfter few days, Swami Sri Haridas Ji entered Nikunj Leela, 7 days after his departure, Vithal Vipul Dev Ji also entered Nikunja. After that Viharin Dev Ji became the Acharya. Shri Biharin Dev Ji remained Acharya of the sect for a long time.\nCompositions:\nHis compositions has two parts - one is the principal aspect, the other is the aspect of the Rasa (Nectar). The composition of Rasa is a reflection of his experience. The way he felt while living as a part of Shri Lalita Ji in a sarcastic form, the experience of inner heart came out as the voice of the Rasa, which the curious followers and Rasik saints drink and feel the nectar of Nitya Vihar Rasa. He himself has said -\n\u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f \u0905\u0927\u0930 \u0938\u0941\u0927\u093e \u092e\u0939\u093e \u092e\u0927\u0941 \u092e\u0924\u094d\u0924 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u093f \u0915\u094c\u0924\u0941\u0915 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u094c\u0964\n\u0915\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u0915\u094c \u0938\u0941\u0916 \u0905\u0932\u094d\u092a \u0938\u0916\u093f \u0938\u0941\u0928\u093f \u0915\u0939\u094d\u092f\u094c \u092d\u0930\u093f \u0909\u092e\u0901\u0917\u094d\u092f\u094c \u0939\u093f\u092f\u094c\u0965\nHis compositions are very different for a normal sadhak\u2019s (spiritual aspirant) understanding. He was indulged in this pure happiness where the seeker and the master are so united that now the master considers his seekers equal to himself or rather higher than himself, and, seeker keeps on giving selflessly without actually seeking anything from his master. Because of his continuous thought for his master\u2019s happiness alone, he seeks blessings for his master's happiness only. That is how he narrates in his padas related to Shyama Shyam. Therefore He gives blessings to the pair of Radha Krishn.\n\"\u0926\u0947\u0924 \u0906\u0938\u0940\u0938 \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0928\u093f \u0926\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0939\u0941\u0902 \u0928\u0935\u0932 \u0928\u093f\u0924 \u0930\u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u201c\nHe even says, due to his immense love for Kishori Ji, Shri Radharani, he doesn\u2019t mind Bihariji, which he describes in the lines:\n\"\u0915\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u0930\u0939\u0948 \u0910\u0902\u0921 \u092c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0939\u0942\u0901 \u0938\u094c\u0902, \u0939\u092e \u092c\u0947\u092a\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0939 \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0928\u093f \u0915\u0947\u201c\nThis says as Since we belong to Shri Radha, So we are fearless from everyone including Shri Krishn.\nSwami Shri Biharin Dev Ji entered Nikunja around 1670. His samadhi is still in Nidhivan. In his disciple tradition, Swami Shri Nagaridas Ji and Shri Saras Das were his main followers."

One must not think that Lord Krishna left Braj. Lord Krishna never leaves from Braj then the question has arisen that how Mathura, Dwarika pastimes flourished in the earth. Then Rasik Saints answer that during the appearance time of Lord Krishna in this earth all his forms like Narayan, Vishnu, Mahavishnu got absorbed within him. Narayan form of Lord Krishna has been sent to Dwarika, Lord Krishna himself never left Braj and neither he is going to leave as well."

One must not think that Lord Krishna left Braj. Lord Krishna never leaves from Braj then the question has arisen that how Mathura, Dwarika pastimes flourished in the earth. Then Rasik Saints answer that during the appearance time of Lord Krishna in this earth all his forms like Narayan, Vishnu, Mahavishnu got absorbed within him. Narayan form of Lord Krishna has been sent to Dwarika, Lord Krishna himself never left Braj and neither he is going to leave as well."

Berchha.\nSpiritual Life:\nHe was a devotee and was inclined towards sage service since childhood. Once Radhavallabhiya Rasik Shri Chaturbhuj Das Ji, who was a resident of a village called Gadha of Madhya Pradesh, visited his village along with the saint congregation. With his satsang, he got attracted towards Nitya Vihar Upasna.\nVrindavan Arrival:\nUnder the influence of Shri Chaturbhuj Das's satsang, Shri Neh Nagridas Ji left home and went to Vrindavan. Along with him, his benevolent queen Bhagmati of Orchha also went. After going there, both of them took initiation from Radhavallabh Acharya Goswami Vanchandra Ji and started their practice of Nitya Vihar Upasna.\nHe has introduced himself as follows.\n\"Sundar Shri Barsano Nivaas Aur Baas Bason Shri Vrindavan Dham Hai.\nDevi Hamaare Shri Radhika Nagri Got Saun Shri Harivansh Naam Hai.\nDev Hamaare Shriradhikavallabh Rasik Anany Sabha Vishram Hai.\nNaam Hai Nagridasi Ali Vrishbhan Lali Ki Gali Ko Gulam Hai.\u201d\nBarsana Arrival:\nShri Neh Nagridas Ji had great faith in the Vani of Shri Hitharivansh and in the Nitya Vihar of Shri Shyama Shyam. He would take up one of the poems of Hit Vani every day and do contemplation day and night. In front of Hit Vani, the story of Rasleela and Shrimad Bhagwat also seemed to have faded. Therefore, he often stayed away from joining it. Some non-devotional worshipers of Vrindavan used to criticize his behavior.\nOnce upon a time, Goswami Shri Nagarvar Ji, son of Vanchandra Ji was telling the story of Bhagwat in the temple of Radhavallabh Ji. Opponents complained to him for not being involved in the narrative of Nagaridas. On this, Nagarwar Ji called Nagaridas and said, 'Nowadays the story of Dasam-Skandha is going on. You must listen to this. Nagridas Ji appeared in the Katha-Mandap on that day by obeying the Guru's son. Dhenukasur-slaughter's story was going on. As soon as the story was heard that Shri Krishna holding the legs of Dhenukasura's assistant's asses and slamming, Nagridas Ji stood up in a hurry and went out of the hall. Due to this behavior, all the people present there were upset. On the second day when Goswami Nagarvar Ji called him and asked the reason for accidentally getting up from the Katha Mandap, he said - 'At that time I was absorbed in the poem of pastimes of Shri Hitacharya, in which Shyamsundar was persuading Shri Radha by holding her chin with his tender hand.\nAaju Nikunj Manju Mein Khelat, Naval Kishor Naveen Kisori.\nHari Ur Mukur Biloki Apanpau, Vibhram Vikal Maanjut Bhori.\nChibuk Suchaaru Praloi Prabodhit, Piy Pratibimb Janai Nihori.\nNeti Neti Vachnamrit Suni Suni, Lalitadik Dekhati Duri Chori.\nHit Harivansh Karat Kar Dhoonan, Pranay Kop Malavali Tori.\nMeanwhile, in my ears, the words of Shri Krishna holding Dhenukasura's associate asses and banging. The thought came into my mind how Shri Krishna, who is holding Priya's tender chin, will hold the donkey's leg with his lotus hand.\nChibuk Sucharu Praloi Prabodhit,\nTinkar Gadahani Paga Kyon Sobhit.\nUnexpected disruption ruined my inner sentiment and I rushed out. With this explanation, Goswami Nagarwar Ji got him heartily after finding the high spiritual status of Nagaridas Ji. Despite this, the cynics did not stop pursuing him. So, being disgusted, he left Vrindavan and went to Radha Ji's Pastimes place Barsana. The true expression of despair and helplessness arising out of the malicious behavior of cynicists is found in his following Saakhi -\nJinake Bal Nidharak Hute, Tei Bairi Bhaye Baan.\nTarakas Ke Sar Saanp Hvai, Phiri-phiri Laage Khaan.\nIn Barsana, he built his hut on the hill of Gaharvan, which is famous today as Mor Kuti.\nShri Radharani Darshan:\nIt is said that one day, Shri Radhaji, along with his friends, appeared and gave him darshan. As soon as he saw the splendid celestial form of Shri Radha, he became dumb. In this situation, he heard Radha Ji saying -\nBhukhe Hain Ham Aadhi Rain, Ya Biriya Khvaavai Tab Chain.\nBarsane Mein Asthal Karau, Meri Barasgaanth Ur Dharau.\n(We come here every day to play here. We feel hungry at midnight. Can you give us food at midnight? Build my temple in Barsana and organize my birth anniversary regularly.)\nNagaridas Ji gave a very delicious meal to Radhaji at midnight and continued to live this rule of Nishith-Bhog (kheer and puri). At that time, Radha Ji had said to build a temple in Barsana and celebrate the birth anniversary every year. For this, Nagaridas Ji, with the help of his benevolent queen Bhagmati, built the Shri Radha Temple there and established the tradition of celebrating Radhashtami festival with great pomp, which is still going on uninterruptedly.\nText composition:\nThe works of Neh Nagaridas can be divided into three sections according to the subject -\nSiddhanta Dohavali\n(verses: 35),\nRas Padavali\n(verses: 232) and\nPadavali\n(verses: 102). In these, respectively, Glories of Shri Hita Harivansh and the representation of devotion-theory propounded by him, Vihar Lila of the adorable couple, Glory of Raas, Vrindavan and Barsana, Emotional representation of subjects are enlightened.\nNagaridas Ji's name is foremost among the Rasik's who have given a systematic shape to the Shri Hrit Harivansh Goswami sect by his personality and work. Shri Dhruvdas and Chacha Vrindavandas have mentioned him as a devoted devotee."

Berchha.\nSpiritual Life:\nHe was a devotee and was inclined towards sage service since childhood. Once Radhavallabhiya Rasik Shri Chaturbhuj Das Ji, who was a resident of a village called Gadha of Madhya Pradesh, visited his village along with the saint congregation. With his satsang, he got attracted towards Nitya Vihar Upasna.\nVrindavan Arrival:\nUnder the influence of Shri Chaturbhuj Das's satsang, Shri Neh Nagridas Ji left home and went to Vrindavan. Along with him, his benevolent queen Bhagmati of Orchha also went. After going there, both of them took initiation from Radhavallabh Acharya Goswami Vanchandra Ji and started their practice of Nitya Vihar Upasna.\nHe has introduced himself as follows.\n\"Sundar Shri Barsano Nivaas Aur Baas Bason Shri Vrindavan Dham Hai.\nDevi Hamaare Shri Radhika Nagri Got Saun Shri Harivansh Naam Hai.\nDev Hamaare Shriradhikavallabh Rasik Anany Sabha Vishram Hai.\nNaam Hai Nagridasi Ali Vrishbhan Lali Ki Gali Ko Gulam Hai.\u201d\nBarsana Arrival:\nShri Neh Nagridas Ji had great faith in the Vani of Shri Hitharivansh and in the Nitya Vihar of Shri Shyama Shyam. He would take up one of the poems of Hit Vani every day and do contemplation day and night. In front of Hit Vani, the story of Rasleela and Shrimad Bhagwat also seemed to have faded. Therefore, he often stayed away from joining it. Some non-devotional worshipers of Vrindavan used to criticize his behavior.\nOnce upon a time, Goswami Shri Nagarvar Ji, son of Vanchandra Ji was telling the story of Bhagwat in the temple of Radhavallabh Ji. Opponents complained to him for not being involved in the narrative of Nagaridas. On this, Nagarwar Ji called Nagaridas and said, 'Nowadays the story of Dasam-Skandha is going on. You must listen to this. Nagridas Ji appeared in the Katha-Mandap on that day by obeying the Guru's son. Dhenukasur-slaughter's story was going on. As soon as the story was heard that Shri Krishna holding the legs of Dhenukasura's assistant's asses and slamming, Nagridas Ji stood up in a hurry and went out of the hall. Due to this behavior, all the people present there were upset. On the second day when Goswami Nagarvar Ji called him and asked the reason for accidentally getting up from the Katha Mandap, he said - 'At that time I was absorbed in the poem of pastimes of Shri Hitacharya, in which Shyamsundar was persuading Shri Radha by holding her chin with his tender hand.\nAaju Nikunj Manju Mein Khelat, Naval Kishor Naveen Kisori.\nHari Ur Mukur Biloki Apanpau, Vibhram Vikal Maanjut Bhori.\nChibuk Suchaaru Praloi Prabodhit, Piy Pratibimb Janai Nihori.\nNeti Neti Vachnamrit Suni Suni, Lalitadik Dekhati Duri Chori.\nHit Harivansh Karat Kar Dhoonan, Pranay Kop Malavali Tori.\nMeanwhile, in my ears, the words of Shri Krishna holding Dhenukasura's associate asses and banging. The thought came into my mind how Shri Krishna, who is holding Priya's tender chin, will hold the donkey's leg with his lotus hand.\nChibuk Sucharu Praloi Prabodhit,\nTinkar Gadahani Paga Kyon Sobhit.\nUnexpected disruption ruined my inner sentiment and I rushed out. With this explanation, Goswami Nagarwar Ji got him heartily after finding the high spiritual status of Nagaridas Ji. Despite this, the cynics did not stop pursuing him. So, being disgusted, he left Vrindavan and went to Radha Ji's Pastimes place Barsana. The true expression of despair and helplessness arising out of the malicious behavior of cynicists is found in his following Saakhi -\nJinake Bal Nidharak Hute, Tei Bairi Bhaye Baan.\nTarakas Ke Sar Saanp Hvai, Phiri-phiri Laage Khaan.\nIn Barsana, he built his hut on the hill of Gaharvan, which is famous today as Mor Kuti.\nShri Radharani Darshan:\nIt is said that one day, Shri Radhaji, along with his friends, appeared and gave him darshan. As soon as he saw the splendid celestial form of Shri Radha, he became dumb. In this situation, he heard Radha Ji saying -\nBhukhe Hain Ham Aadhi Rain, Ya Biriya Khvaavai Tab Chain.\nBarsane Mein Asthal Karau, Meri Barasgaanth Ur Dharau.\n(We come here every day to play here. We feel hungry at midnight. Can you give us food at midnight? Build my temple in Barsana and organize my birth anniversary regularly.)\nNagaridas Ji gave a very delicious meal to Radhaji at midnight and continued to live this rule of Nishith-Bhog (kheer and puri). At that time, Radha Ji had said to build a temple in Barsana and celebrate the birth anniversary every year. For this, Nagaridas Ji, with the help of his benevolent queen Bhagmati, built the Shri Radha Temple there and established the tradition of celebrating Radhashtami festival with great pomp, which is still going on uninterruptedly.\nText composition:\nThe works of Neh Nagaridas can be divided into three sections according to the subject -\nSiddhanta Dohavali\n(verses: 35),\nRas Padavali\n(verses: 232) and\nPadavali\n(verses: 102). In these, respectively, Glories of Shri Hita Harivansh and the representation of devotion-theory propounded by him, Vihar Lila of the adorable couple, Glory of Raas, Vrindavan and Barsana, Emotional representation of subjects are enlightened.\nNagaridas Ji's name is foremost among the Rasik's who have given a systematic shape to the Shri Hrit Harivansh Goswami sect by his personality and work. Shri Dhruvdas and Chacha Vrindavandas have mentioned him as a devoted devotee."

tree. This place has a very great significance because Shri Krishn used to call his cows standing under the Kadamb tree. Even today, Gopashtami festival is celebrated here in a very traditional way. This is also meditation site of Shri Roop Goswami. On the instructions of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shri Roop Goswami came to Braj and started doing his Bhajan here. So this is also the Bhajan Sthali of Shri Roop Goswami.\nThere is some famous incidence of his life which are as such: One day Shri Rupa Goswami wanted to prepare some sweet rice for Sanatana Goswami, but didn't have the necessary provisions for making sweet rice in his Kutir. At that time, she who brings about the fulfillment of the inner aspiration of devotees, Radha Rani, could understand everything. And so, in the dress of a young gopi girl she brought milk, rice, and sugar to Rupa Goswami, saying, \"Swamiji! Swamiji! I have brought you a gift of uncooked rice. Please accept it. Hearing the words of the young girl, Shri Rupa Goswami opened the door to his hut and looked out. There he saw a beautiful young gopi maiden with some offerings of food. Accepting the offering of milk, sugar and uncooked rice, When Rupa Goswami turned around and saw that she had gone, he was very bewildered by all this. After some time, he gave the prasada to Sanatana Goswami, who had just arrived. While honoring prasada, Sanatana Goswami experienced an unusual and enchanting kind of joy. He asked Shri Rupa, \"Where did you get this milk and rice from?\" Rupa Goswami said, \"A young gopi girl came by and gave it to me.\" Sanatana said, \"A young girl just came by all of a sudden and gave you this milk and rice?\" Rupa Goswami replied, \"Yes, she just came by all of a sudden. The strange thing is, I was just thinking, 'how can I make some sweet rice for Sanatana,' and she just appeared, as if by magic, with this milk and rice and some sugar.\" hearing this, tears of prema began falling from the eyes of Sanatana Goswami. He said, \"Can't you recognize something when it is right before your eyes? It was Shri Radha Thakurani Herself who has brought you milk and rice. By accepting service from Her we are ruined. Now we shall never attain our desired goal.\" And in this way, Sanatana Goswami and Roop Goswami out of extreme humbleness continually condemned himself again and again for having accepted service from that person whom he most aspired to serve: Shri Radha Thakurani. From that day onwards, the prasada of 'Kheer' is also served daily at Tera Kadamb, Also once remembering an instance of separation of Shri Radha Krishn, Shri Roop Goswami felt extremely distraught. When his breath touched some person, he got boils over his body. Both of these pastimes of Shri Sanatana Goswami are recorded in the Bhakti Ratnakara."

tree. This place has a very great significance because Shri Krishn used to call his cows standing under the Kadamb tree. Even today, Gopashtami festival is celebrated here in a very traditional way. This is also meditation site of Shri Roop Goswami. On the instructions of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shri Roop Goswami came to Braj and started doing his Bhajan here. So this is also the Bhajan Sthali of Shri Roop Goswami.\nThere is some famous incidence of his life which are as such: One day Shri Rupa Goswami wanted to prepare some sweet rice for Sanatana Goswami, but didn't have the necessary provisions for making sweet rice in his Kutir. At that time, she who brings about the fulfillment of the inner aspiration of devotees, Radha Rani, could understand everything. And so, in the dress of a young gopi girl she brought milk, rice, and sugar to Rupa Goswami, saying, \"Swamiji! Swamiji! I have brought you a gift of uncooked rice. Please accept it. Hearing the words of the young girl, Shri Rupa Goswami opened the door to his hut and looked out. There he saw a beautiful young gopi maiden with some offerings of food. Accepting the offering of milk, sugar and uncooked rice, When Rupa Goswami turned around and saw that she had gone, he was very bewildered by all this. After some time, he gave the prasada to Sanatana Goswami, who had just arrived. While honoring prasada, Sanatana Goswami experienced an unusual and enchanting kind of joy. He asked Shri Rupa, \"Where did you get this milk and rice from?\" Rupa Goswami said, \"A young gopi girl came by and gave it to me.\" Sanatana said, \"A young girl just came by all of a sudden and gave you this milk and rice?\" Rupa Goswami replied, \"Yes, she just came by all of a sudden. The strange thing is, I was just thinking, 'how can I make some sweet rice for Sanatana,' and she just appeared, as if by magic, with this milk and rice and some sugar.\" hearing this, tears of prema began falling from the eyes of Sanatana Goswami. He said, \"Can't you recognize something when it is right before your eyes? It was Shri Radha Thakurani Herself who has brought you milk and rice. By accepting service from Her we are ruined. Now we shall never attain our desired goal.\" And in this way, Sanatana Goswami and Roop Goswami out of extreme humbleness continually condemned himself again and again for having accepted service from that person whom he most aspired to serve: Shri Radha Thakurani. From that day onwards, the prasada of 'Kheer' is also served daily at Tera Kadamb, Also once remembering an instance of separation of Shri Radha Krishn, Shri Roop Goswami felt extremely distraught. When his breath touched some person, he got boils over his body. Both of these pastimes of Shri Sanatana Goswami are recorded in the Bhakti Ratnakara."

Vajranabha Maharaja manifested Uddhava-Kunda under the guidance of Sandilya and other sages. Uddhav Ji always resides near by here as grass and shrubs in order to be sprinkled by the foot-dust of the gopis. The Shrimad Bhagwatam Mahatma of the Skanda Purana gives an interesting description of this place.\nAfter the disappearance of Shri Krishn, His queens in Dvaraka were greatly afflicted by sorrow. Once, Vajrnabh came here with them and they loudly performed sankirtan. In that great sankirtan, all the associates of Krishna started to appear one by one. The associates of Dwarika all sang and danced, and Arjuna began to dance and play mridanga. Suddenly, that exalted soul, Shri Uddhava emerged from the grass and shrubs, and he also became immersed in dancing in that maha-sankirtan. How could Krishna not come there? Finally, He also appeared in that maha-sankirtan ras, along with Shri Radhika and the other sakhis and, after some time, disappeared again. In this way, Uddhava pacified the queens at this place.\nLocation\n:\nUddhav Kunda is Located at Goverdhan near to Kusum Sarovar."

Vajranabha Maharaja manifested Uddhava-Kunda under the guidance of Sandilya and other sages. Uddhav Ji always resides near by here as grass and shrubs in order to be sprinkled by the foot-dust of the gopis. The Shrimad Bhagwatam Mahatma of the Skanda Purana gives an interesting description of this place.\nAfter the disappearance of Shri Krishn, His queens in Dvaraka were greatly afflicted by sorrow. Once, Vajrnabh came here with them and they loudly performed sankirtan. In that great sankirtan, all the associates of Krishna started to appear one by one. The associates of Dwarika all sang and danced, and Arjuna began to dance and play mridanga. Suddenly, that exalted soul, Shri Uddhava emerged from the grass and shrubs, and he also became immersed in dancing in that maha-sankirtan. How could Krishna not come there? Finally, He also appeared in that maha-sankirtan ras, along with Shri Radhika and the other sakhis and, after some time, disappeared again. In this way, Uddhava pacified the queens at this place.\nLocation\n:\nUddhav Kunda is Located at Goverdhan near to Kusum Sarovar."

As a result of, the strong belief in divine love has arisen in my heart. Since then, I have attained this personal incessant tressure of Shri Priya Priytam. Shri Shukdeva, Shri Narada, Shri Sanakadik, Scriptures etc have only given the pointer about this treasure of Vrindavan called \"Nitya Vihar\", but they have not explained and showered in detail or it is beyond the comprehension of even the Vedas. Shri Bhagwat Rasik says, this Rasopasna is like this that it exposes all the 'Saundarya' (beauty) of Priya Priytam (Shri Radha Krishn) in the secret groves. So without receiving this divine vision of this \u2018bhava' (given by the grace of Kishoriji), one can never experience this nectarean love of Nitya Vihar."

As a result of, the strong belief in divine love has arisen in my heart. Since then, I have attained this personal incessant tressure of Shri Priya Priytam. Shri Shukdeva, Shri Narada, Shri Sanakadik, Scriptures etc have only given the pointer about this treasure of Vrindavan called \"Nitya Vihar\", but they have not explained and showered in detail or it is beyond the comprehension of even the Vedas. Shri Bhagwat Rasik says, this Rasopasna is like this that it exposes all the 'Saundarya' (beauty) of Priya Priytam (Shri Radha Krishn) in the secret groves. So without receiving this divine vision of this \u2018bhava' (given by the grace of Kishoriji), one can never experience this nectarean love of Nitya Vihar."

Seva Kunja was formerly called Nikunjavana, and was one of twelve small forest groves of Vrindavan also called upavanas. Sometimes when the Puranas refer to Seva Kunja, it refers to all twelve of the sub-forests that form the inner-most core of the vast and expansive forest of Vrindavan.\nAccording to the Puranas, the whole area bordered by the River Yamuna, from Mohana Ter Ghata to Adi-Badri Ghata was referred to as being Seva kunja or Nikunja Vana. Therefore, such places as Kaliya-Ghata, Madana-mohana, Imli Tala, Radha Damodara, Shringara Vata, Govinda Ghata, Chehana Ghata, Keshi Ghata, Nidhuvana, Jhulanavana, Gopinatha, Dira Samira, Vamsi Vata, Gopishwara, Brahma-kunda, Govinda-kunda and Govindaji Yoga-pitha, are also considered to be different lila-sthanas within Nikunja Vana.\nIn this particular forest grove, Yugal Sarkar performs Rasa pastimes. After that Krishna massaged Radharani\u2019s lotus feet and decorated them with red yavaka (vermillion) and he combs Her long black hair into braids, and applied cosmetics to Her moon-like face, and dressed Her with silken garments and gem-encrusted ornaments. After the rasa-dance was over the gopis would prepare a soft bed made of flower petals and invite Radha and Krishna to lie down together and rest. The whole area where these divine pastimes happens day and night is called Nikunja Vana or Sewa Kunj. Shri Hita Harivansh Mahaprabhu, an incarnation of Shri Krishn's flute, performed bhajana here. His Samadhi is also located here.\nTimings of Temple:\nSummer\nMangla Aarti: 05:30 AM\nShringar Aarti: 08:30 AM\nRajbhog Aarti: 12:30 PM\nSandhya Aarti: 5:30 PM\nShayan Aarti: 7:15 PM\nWinter\nMangla Aarti: 07:00 AM\nShringar Aarti: 09:00 AM\nRajbhog Aarti: 12:00 PM\nSandhya Aarti: 4:30 PM\nShayan Aarti: 6:30 PM"

Seva Kunja was formerly called Nikunjavana, and was one of twelve small forest groves of Vrindavan also called upavanas. Sometimes when the Puranas refer to Seva Kunja, it refers to all twelve of the sub-forests that form the inner-most core of the vast and expansive forest of Vrindavan.\nAccording to the Puranas, the whole area bordered by the River Yamuna, from Mohana Ter Ghata to Adi-Badri Ghata was referred to as being Seva kunja or Nikunja Vana. Therefore, such places as Kaliya-Ghata, Madana-mohana, Imli Tala, Radha Damodara, Shringara Vata, Govinda Ghata, Chehana Ghata, Keshi Ghata, Nidhuvana, Jhulanavana, Gopinatha, Dira Samira, Vamsi Vata, Gopishwara, Brahma-kunda, Govinda-kunda and Govindaji Yoga-pitha, are also considered to be different lila-sthanas within Nikunja Vana.\nIn this particular forest grove, Yugal Sarkar performs Rasa pastimes. After that Krishna massaged Radharani\u2019s lotus feet and decorated them with red yavaka (vermillion) and he combs Her long black hair into braids, and applied cosmetics to Her moon-like face, and dressed Her with silken garments and gem-encrusted ornaments. After the rasa-dance was over the gopis would prepare a soft bed made of flower petals and invite Radha and Krishna to lie down together and rest. The whole area where these divine pastimes happens day and night is called Nikunja Vana or Sewa Kunj. Shri Hita Harivansh Mahaprabhu, an incarnation of Shri Krishn's flute, performed bhajana here. His Samadhi is also located here.\nTimings of Temple:\nSummer\nMangla Aarti: 05:30 AM\nShringar Aarti: 08:30 AM\nRajbhog Aarti: 12:30 PM\nSandhya Aarti: 5:30 PM\nShayan Aarti: 7:15 PM\nWinter\nMangla Aarti: 07:00 AM\nShringar Aarti: 09:00 AM\nRajbhog Aarti: 12:00 PM\nSandhya Aarti: 4:30 PM\nShayan Aarti: 6:30 PM"

One can't attain another's owned property. Otherwise, these 'Vanis' (Writings of Rasik Saints) would not appeal to the one who is finding great interest in sensual desires. One would not be able to relish the bliss and would turn away from these 'Vanis'. Shri Bhagvatrasik says the world can just read the spiritual writings of the spiritual master and Rasik saints, but the actual 'Nitya Vihaar' (eternal ever-going loveplay of Yugal Sarkar) mentioned by Rasiks, can only be acquired by rarest most eligible devotees. In fact, Shri Bhagavad Rasik says the Nitya Vihaar, which gives unlimited happiness to Shri Radha Krishn as well, is very rarely obtained to the most eligible devotee."

One can't attain another's owned property. Otherwise, these 'Vanis' (Writings of Rasik Saints) would not appeal to the one who is finding great interest in sensual desires. One would not be able to relish the bliss and would turn away from these 'Vanis'. Shri Bhagvatrasik says the world can just read the spiritual writings of the spiritual master and Rasik saints, but the actual 'Nitya Vihaar' (eternal ever-going loveplay of Yugal Sarkar) mentioned by Rasiks, can only be acquired by rarest most eligible devotees. In fact, Shri Bhagavad Rasik says the Nitya Vihaar, which gives unlimited happiness to Shri Radha Krishn as well, is very rarely obtained to the most eligible devotee."

This is the place where the famous pastime of Baby Krishna stealing the clothes of the Gopis (Cowherd Maidens) of Vrindavan took place. This place was earlier just on the banks of River Yamuna. But over the years, as Yamuna has changed its course, now Chir Ghat stands at some distance from the Yamuna. There is an ancient Kadamba tree at this place which is still existing since the time of Lord Krishna. Devotees of Vrindavan still worship this tree and even make offerings to this tree. Its also said in the Vedas, that Shri Krishna rarely goes to the samadhis of Paramhans, but here in Braj, he is stealing the clothes of Gopis. That's why the Braj Ras (Bliss of Braj) is highest among all (i:e among Saket Lok, Vaikunth Lok etc). As Shri Krishna states himself in Gita: \"ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101ns tathaiva bhaj\u0101myaham\" Bhagwat Gita(4.11), Sri Krishna says \u201cIn whatever way people surrender unto me, I reciprocate with them accordingly\u201d."

This is the place where the famous pastime of Baby Krishna stealing the clothes of the Gopis (Cowherd Maidens) of Vrindavan took place. This place was earlier just on the banks of River Yamuna. But over the years, as Yamuna has changed its course, now Chir Ghat stands at some distance from the Yamuna. There is an ancient Kadamba tree at this place which is still existing since the time of Lord Krishna. Devotees of Vrindavan still worship this tree and even make offerings to this tree. Its also said in the Vedas, that Shri Krishna rarely goes to the samadhis of Paramhans, but here in Braj, he is stealing the clothes of Gopis. That's why the Braj Ras (Bliss of Braj) is highest among all (i:e among Saket Lok, Vaikunth Lok etc). As Shri Krishna states himself in Gita: \"ye yath\u0101 m\u0101\u1e41 prapadyante t\u0101ns tathaiva bhaj\u0101myaham\" Bhagwat Gita(4.11), Sri Krishna says \u201cIn whatever way people surrender unto me, I reciprocate with them accordingly\u201d."

Vrindavan. Shri Rasik Bihari Dev Ju says, It's due to utmost fortune, that one gets a residence (or visit) in Shri Vrindavan Dham.\nThe dust of this place is rarely achieved even by the heavenly & celestial beings, human beings, sages, and even Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva. [1]\nThis rare human life has been wasted innumerable times without the dust of Vrindavan (Dust of Shri Radha\u2019s lotus feet).\nThe same dust has graced me and provided me with the topmost shelter and immense bliss.\u00a0 [2]\nOne who comes to Vrindavan meets their actual relatives after a long time i.e. Shri Shyama Shyam and sakhis (their Rasik devotees). Those relatives welcome us with their open arms and Shri Hari opens his arms to embrace the soul happily.\nShri Shyama Shyam continually dwells together in the different places of Vrindavan and helps us meet their other Sakhi devotees (Rasiks gathering 'Samaaj') and helps us provide their association. [3]\nAfter reaching to this divine place, meeting the devotees, and getting the grace of Shyama Shyama and the dust of Vrindavan, no one should ever be sad again, since one has hit the target on the right spot and the rat race of uncountable lifetimes finally over.\nShri Rasik Bihari Dev says, that one gets the love of Shri Bihariji and Biharini Shri Radharani and should consider oneself to be very fortunate to be blessed with the holy dust of Vrindavan.

Vrindavan. Shri Rasik Bihari Dev Ju says, It's due to utmost fortune, that one gets a residence (or visit) in Shri Vrindavan Dham.\nThe dust of this place is rarely achieved even by the heavenly & celestial beings, human beings, sages, and even Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva. [1]\nThis rare human life has been wasted innumerable times without the dust of Vrindavan (Dust of Shri Radha\u2019s lotus feet).\nThe same dust has graced me and provided me with the topmost shelter and immense bliss.\u00a0 [2]\nOne who comes to Vrindavan meets their actual relatives after a long time i.e. Shri Shyama Shyam and sakhis (their Rasik devotees). Those relatives welcome us with their open arms and Shri Hari opens his arms to embrace the soul happily.\nShri Shyama Shyam continually dwells together in the different places of Vrindavan and helps us meet their other Sakhi devotees (Rasiks gathering 'Samaaj') and helps us provide their association. [3]\nAfter reaching to this divine place, meeting the devotees, and getting the grace of Shyama Shyama and the dust of Vrindavan, no one should ever be sad again, since one has hit the target on the right spot and the rat race of uncountable lifetimes finally over.\nShri Rasik Bihari Dev says, that one gets the love of Shri Bihariji and Biharini Shri Radharani and should consider oneself to be very fortunate to be blessed with the holy dust of Vrindavan.

Like a great Yogi He is constantly wakeful through hours that are ages for him.

appeared in Bundelkhand in 1692 and left for Nikunj in 1758. For some time Sri Rasik Dev Ji stayed in Kaliyadah at Vrindavan and later went to stay at Sri Rasik Bihari temple founded by himself. Sri Rasik Bihari Ji appeared in Nidhivan and stayed in Udaipur and Dungarpur too. From there they were positioned at Rasik Bihari temple and served with love and devotion.\nHe was a devoted disciple of Shri Narhari Devji, being his favorite and the best one. Shri Radha-Krishna was gracious towards him and it is believed that Shri Bihariji Thakur had asked him to accept Shri Narhari Devji as his guru. Sri Swami Rasik Dev Ji was a revolutionary by nature and was a perfect disciple. Sri Swami Rasik Dev Ji believed in changing with the times and adapting new things accordingly. But his guru was not in favor of this and he used to get upset because of this nature of Sri Swami Rasik Dev Ji's.\nShri Keshavdasji, his fellow disciple, could not tolerate his devotion and closeness with Guru Ji and kept complaining about him. To calm this dispute Guru Ji sent Rasik Devji to Mathura to underpin the greatness of his servitude. Here too he begged for alms and served his guru. Another disciple Shri Changa Sunar would get guruji\u2019s 'gati' and 'langoti' which Rasikji has washed for his guru. One day Shri Narharidevji hurt his head and Shri Rasik Devji caught hold of his own as if in pain, very well aware that his guru was in suffering. Shri Rasik Devji held the position of a guru from 1741-1758 and was the teacher of Shri Lalit Kishore Devji, founder of Tatiya.\nHe initiated 52 disciples, of whom 3 made their own setups. They were:\n1. Sri Govind Dev Ji sat at Gori Lal Ji Ki Kunj\n2. Sri Lalit Kishori Dev Ji sat at Tatiya Sthan\n3. Sri Pitamber Dev Ji sat at Rasik Bihari temple."

appeared in Bundelkhand in 1692 and left for Nikunj in 1758. For some time Sri Rasik Dev Ji stayed in Kaliyadah at Vrindavan and later went to stay at Sri Rasik Bihari temple founded by himself. Sri Rasik Bihari Ji appeared in Nidhivan and stayed in Udaipur and Dungarpur too. From there they were positioned at Rasik Bihari temple and served with love and devotion.\nHe was a devoted disciple of Shri Narhari Devji, being his favorite and the best one. Shri Radha-Krishna was gracious towards him and it is believed that Shri Bihariji Thakur had asked him to accept Shri Narhari Devji as his guru. Sri Swami Rasik Dev Ji was a revolutionary by nature and was a perfect disciple. Sri Swami Rasik Dev Ji believed in changing with the times and adapting new things accordingly. But his guru was not in favor of this and he used to get upset because of this nature of Sri Swami Rasik Dev Ji's.\nShri Keshavdasji, his fellow disciple, could not tolerate his devotion and closeness with Guru Ji and kept complaining about him. To calm this dispute Guru Ji sent Rasik Devji to Mathura to underpin the greatness of his servitude. Here too he begged for alms and served his guru. Another disciple Shri Changa Sunar would get guruji\u2019s 'gati' and 'langoti' which Rasikji has washed for his guru. One day Shri Narharidevji hurt his head and Shri Rasik Devji caught hold of his own as if in pain, very well aware that his guru was in suffering. Shri Rasik Devji held the position of a guru from 1741-1758 and was the teacher of Shri Lalit Kishore Devji, founder of Tatiya.\nHe initiated 52 disciples, of whom 3 made their own setups. They were:\n1. Sri Govind Dev Ji sat at Gori Lal Ji Ki Kunj\n2. Sri Lalit Kishori Dev Ji sat at Tatiya Sthan\n3. Sri Pitamber Dev Ji sat at Rasik Bihari temple."

This 1.25 lac pada's compiled in a book called as Sur-Sagar or Sur-Padavali. Although he was blind, he would compose poems that beautifully described the different outfits and decorations of Shri Nath Ji. One day, the priest did not dress Shri Nath Ji and left Him completely naked. He opened the doors of the altar and asked Shri Surdas to describe Shri Nath\u2019s decorations. Shri Surdas remained silent for a few moments, but the priest insisted. Shri Surdas laughed loudly and proceeded to sing, \u201cAj bhaye hari nangam nanga \u2013 today, Hari is undressed and naked.\u201d All present were stunned to hear this.\nShri Surdas also did Parayan of Shrimadbhagwat here. He spent his last days in Parasauli. One day, Shri Vitthalanath Ji, the son of Shri Vallabhacharya Ji, asked him, \u201cSur, what are you thinking about?\u201d\nShri Surdas then composed his last song:\n\u201cKhanjan nain roop ras mate,\natishay charu chapal aniyare pal pinjara na samate\"\n\u2013 Krishna\u2019s beautiful eyes are like Khanjan birds. They are full of rasa, very restless, and slightly reddened due to intoxication. My life can no longer remain encaged in this body.\u201d\nSaying this, he left his body. With tear-filled eyes, Shri Vitthalanath Ji said, \u201cThe boat of Pushti-Marga has departed today.\u201d\nIn the south-eastern part of Parasauli is Sankarshan-Kunda, on whose bank is a temple of Shri Baladeva.\nLocation:\nParasauli village lies about one-and-a-quarter miles south-east of Govardhana Town in the lowlands of Govardhana."

Shila\nNear the Sarovar under a chakora tree is the sitting-place of Shri Vallabhacharya. The Kunda and samadhi of Shri Surdas or Soordas, known simply as Sur-Kund and Sur-Samadhi, are also in this area.\nShri Surdas was a natural poet. He composed one lac pada's with the chhap of \"Surdas\" and Shri Shyamsundar composed 25000 pada's with the chhap of \"Sur Shyam\". This 1.25 lac pada's compiled in a book called as Sur-Sagar or Sur-Padavali. Although he was blind, he would compose poems that beautifully described the different outfits and decorations of Shri Nath Ji. One day, the priest did not dress Shri Nath Ji and left Him completely naked. He opened the doors of the altar and asked Shri Surdas to describe Shri Nath\u2019s decorations. Shri Surdas remained silent for a few moments, but the priest insisted. Shri Surdas laughed loudly and proceeded to sing, \u201cAj bhaye hari nangam nanga \u2013 today, Hari is undressed and naked.\u201d All present were stunned to hear this.\nShri Surdas also did Parayan of Shrimadbhagwat here. He spent his last days in Parasauli. One day, Shri Vitthalanath Ji, the son of Shri Vallabhacharya Ji, asked him, \u201cSur, what are you thinking about?\u201d\nShri Surdas then composed his last song:\n\u201cKhanjan nain roop ras mate,\natishay charu chapal aniyare pal pinjara na samate\"\n\u2013 Krishna\u2019s beautiful eyes are like Khanjan birds. They are full of rasa, very restless, and slightly reddened due to intoxication. My life can no longer remain encaged in this body.\u201d\nSaying this, he left his body. With tear-filled eyes, Shri Vitthalanath Ji said, \u201cThe boat of Pushti-Marga has departed today.\u201d\nIn the south-eastern part of Parasauli is Sankarshan-Kunda, on whose bank is a temple of Shri Baladeva.\nLocation:\nParasauli village lies about one-and-a-quarter miles south-east of Govardhana Town in the lowlands of Govardhana."

The temple was built in samwat 1645. Near by is samadhi of Shri Gopal Bhatt Ji who established the temple and service of Shri Radharaman Ji.\nHistory: At the age of thirty, Gopala Bhatta Gosvami came to Vrindavana. After Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's disappearance, Gopala Bhatta Gosvami felt intense separation from the Lord. The Lord instructed Gopala Bhatta in a dream \"If you want my darshan then make a trip to Nepal\". In Nepal, Gopala Bhatta bathed in the famous Kali-Gandaki River. Upon dipping his waterpot in the river, he was surprised to see several Shaligrama shilas enter his pot. This is how he found the Shaligram. A very interesting incident regarding his appearance is famous. Shri Gopal Bhatt Ji Maharaj was doing the service of Shri Shaligram Ji with all sincerity. Once Shri Gopal Bhatt Ji felt the strong desire that \u201cIf the feet, hand and other parts of my Shaligram Ji could be seen, then even I could bedeck him with ornaments.\u201d This is the Glory of Thakur Ji, as in Gita he says \u201cYei Yathamam Prapadyantei Tamsthaiv Bhajamyaham\u201d (Whoever desirous of resorting to me, in whatever manner they think of me according to their inclinations, I favor them in the same manner). This is what happened. Shri Shaligram Ji showed his leela. Next day when Shri Gopal Bhatt Ji went for the daily service he had the darshan of the feet, hands, and face. There was no end to the Joy of Shri Gopal Bhatt Ji.\nTimings of Temple:\nSummer\nMangla Aarti: 05:00 AM\nShringar Aarti:10:00 AM\nRajbhog Aarti: 12:30 PM\nSandhya Aarti: 7:15 PM\nShayan Aarti: 9:30 PM\nSamaj Gayan: [7:30 PM]\nWinter\nMangla Aarti: 05:30 AM\nShringar Aarti:10:30 AM\nRajbhog Aarti: 12:30 PM\nSandhya Aarti: 6:30 PM\nShayan Aarti: 9:00 PM\nSamaj Gayan: [7:00 PM]\nLocation:\nShri Radharaman Ji is located in Vrindavan District Mathura, State Uttar Pradesh, and Country India.

The temple was built in samwat 1645. Near by is samadhi of Shri Gopal Bhatt Ji who established the temple and service of Shri Radharaman Ji.\nHistory: At the age of thirty, Gopala Bhatta Gosvami came to Vrindavana. After Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's disappearance, Gopala Bhatta Gosvami felt intense separation from the Lord. The Lord instructed Gopala Bhatta in a dream \"If you want my darshan then make a trip to Nepal\". In Nepal, Gopala Bhatta bathed in the famous Kali-Gandaki River. Upon dipping his waterpot in the river, he was surprised to see several Shaligrama shilas enter his pot. This is how he found the Shaligram. A very interesting incident regarding his appearance is famous. Shri Gopal Bhatt Ji Maharaj was doing the service of Shri Shaligram Ji with all sincerity. Once Shri Gopal Bhatt Ji felt the strong desire that \u201cIf the feet, hand and other parts of my Shaligram Ji could be seen, then even I could bedeck him with ornaments.\u201d This is the Glory of Thakur Ji, as in Gita he says \u201cYei Yathamam Prapadyantei Tamsthaiv Bhajamyaham\u201d (Whoever desirous of resorting to me, in whatever manner they think of me according to their inclinations, I favor them in the same manner). This is what happened. Shri Shaligram Ji showed his leela. Next day when Shri Gopal Bhatt Ji went for the daily service he had the darshan of the feet, hands, and face. There was no end to the Joy of Shri Gopal Bhatt Ji.\nTimings of Temple:\nSummer\nMangla Aarti: 05:00 AM\nShringar Aarti:10:00 AM\nRajbhog Aarti: 12:30 PM\nSandhya Aarti: 7:15 PM\nShayan Aarti: 9:30 PM\nSamaj Gayan: [7:30 PM]\nWinter\nMangla Aarti: 05:30 AM\nShringar Aarti:10:30 AM\nRajbhog Aarti: 12:30 PM\nSandhya Aarti: 6:30 PM\nShayan Aarti: 9:00 PM\nSamaj Gayan: [7:00 PM]\nLocation:\nShri Radharaman Ji is located in Vrindavan District Mathura, State Uttar Pradesh, and Country India.

One day, He was going to groves in the evening passing through the big trees, where his hair got stuck with falling branches of one of the trees. He tried a lot to detach his hair but he wasn't able to do so. So he sat under the tree saying \u201cwhoever has had my hair stuck to the branches, shall only resolve it, else he will be going lifeless. Three days were passed and baba was still sitting under the tree.\nOne 5-7-year-old beautiful boy came near baba. The boy said politely in Braj language - \u201cBaba can I resolve your stuck hair from branches?\u201d As soon as the boy went ahead to resolve it, Baba suddenly said - \u201cDon't touch it, stay back. Who are you?\u201d Boy - \u201cOhh baba I am from this village only, I was roaming here to feed cows and saw you in this condition so I thought to help you.\u201d Baba - \u201cNo no, stay away. whoever has done this shall resolve it.\u201d\nBoy - \u201cBaba you can tell me the name of the person who had done this, I will call him\u201d.\nBaba - you go from here. I won\u2019t tell you any name. This way, the boy was continuously convincing him but baba didn't agree. When Boy saw that Baba was not willing to take help from him, Suddenly Lord Krishna (with his beautiful flute in his hand) originated from that boy. Lord Krishna then said - Dear Baba! I have done this so here I am.\nAnd as soon as Lord Krishna went ahead to resolve his hair,\nBaba suddenly said - \u201cDon\u2019t touch, Stay back. First, tell me Which Krishn are you?\u201d After listening to Baba's words Shri Krishna thought \u201cwhether there are 5-10 Krishn?\u201d\nThen Shri Krishn said - \u201cWhat do you mean by which Krishn?\u201d\nBaba said - \u201cSee, there are many Krishn. One is Devkinandan Krishn, one is Yashoda Nandan Shree Krishn, one is Dwarika Dheesh Krishn, one is Nitya Nikunj Bihari Shri Krishn\u201d.\nShri Krishn said - \u201cWhich Shri Krishn do you want?\u201d\nBaba- \u201cI am a follower of Nitya Nikunj Bihari.\u201d\nShree Krishn said - \u201cYes, I am the same. Can I do it now?\u201d\nAs soon as Shri Krishna went ahead to resolve it, And baba said - \u201cDon't touch it, stay away. Nitya Nikunj Shri Krishna cannot live without Radha Rani for even a single second and you are standing here alone.\u201d\nAs soon as baba said that, there was a thunderstorm struck in the clouds, and then \u201cShri Vrishbhanu Nandini, Vrindavaneshwari, Shri Radha Rani came in front of baba and said - \u201cOh baba! See now, we both are here. We both are one.\u201d\nWith the presence of both (yugal sarkar) baba was amazed to see them. He started crying in happiness and both of them together resolved baba\u2019s hairs. Yugal Sarkar Ki Jai. Albeli Sarkar Ki Jai. All Glories to the Rasik Saints of Braj."

One day, He was going to groves in the evening passing through the big trees, where his hair got stuck with falling branches of one of the trees. He tried a lot to detach his hair but he wasn't able to do so. So he sat under the tree saying \u201cwhoever has had my hair stuck to the branches, shall only resolve it, else he will be going lifeless. Three days were passed and baba was still sitting under the tree.\nOne 5-7-year-old beautiful boy came near baba. The boy said politely in Braj language - \u201cBaba can I resolve your stuck hair from branches?\u201d As soon as the boy went ahead to resolve it, Baba suddenly said - \u201cDon't touch it, stay back. Who are you?\u201d Boy - \u201cOhh baba I am from this village only, I was roaming here to feed cows and saw you in this condition so I thought to help you.\u201d Baba - \u201cNo no, stay away. whoever has done this shall resolve it.\u201d\nBoy - \u201cBaba you can tell me the name of the person who had done this, I will call him\u201d.\nBaba - you go from here. I won\u2019t tell you any name. This way, the boy was continuously convincing him but baba didn't agree. When Boy saw that Baba was not willing to take help from him, Suddenly Lord Krishna (with his beautiful flute in his hand) originated from that boy. Lord Krishna then said - Dear Baba! I have done this so here I am.\nAnd as soon as Lord Krishna went ahead to resolve his hair,\nBaba suddenly said - \u201cDon\u2019t touch, Stay back. First, tell me Which Krishn are you?\u201d After listening to Baba's words Shri Krishna thought \u201cwhether there are 5-10 Krishn?\u201d\nThen Shri Krishn said - \u201cWhat do you mean by which Krishn?\u201d\nBaba said - \u201cSee, there are many Krishn.

This is how Braj appears in this world directly from Golok Dham."

[5]\nAccording to the Shrimad Bhagwatam, Raas is the final stage of divine love. But Shri Bhagwad Rasik, Rasik Saint of Vrindavan says there is still, even more, higher than Maharaas which is the final stage. The top most and final destination, where one rarely gets qualified to do the personal service of Radharani at Nikunj which is Divine Vrindavan as recommended by Swami Shri Haridas. This stage is achieved by only the Rasiks who are very fortunate, that too by the special mercy of Shri Radha Rani. [6]"

After visiting the other forests of Vrindavan, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came here and sat under this tamala tree. He asked the residents of Aristra-grama where the two Kundas were, but no one could answer. The brahmana accompanying Him from Mathura also did not know. \u201cBeing the omniscient Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya, carefully searched and discovered the two Kundas in two paddy fields. He joyfully took a bath in whatever little water was there and glorified the Kundas in various ways. Then He marked His forehead with mud from the Kundas. \u201cThe villagers were greatly startled by His behavior. One of them inquired, \u2018From where has this sanyasi suddenly come?' Someone said, \u2018O brother, by seeing Him I cannot understand what is happening in my body.' Another person said, \u2018He cannot be a mortal sanyasi. Seeing Him I cannot explain what is happening in my mind.' \u201cSomeone else said, \u2018Who says He is a sanyasi? He is Krishna Himself appearing in this dress and form. Just see the proof. Different birds are all coming for His darshana. The cuckoos and parrots are happily addressing Him as Krishna, and the peacocks are dancing in jubilation. The different sounds of the birds are very pleasing to the ears. \u2018O brother, I repeatedly glorify the good fortune of these creatures, who are seeing Krishna in this form and dress. Dear brothers, let us offer obeisances unto the feet of the Lord, who has incarnated to distribute knowledge to the people. Speaking like this amongst themselves, they all became maddened by the nectarine sight of Mahaprabhu at this holiest site. Even Lord Brahma cannot describe a fragment of Mahaprabhu's ecstatic expression when He discovered these Kundas."

After visiting the other forests of Vrindavan, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came here and sat under this tamala tree. He asked the residents of Aristra-grama where the two Kundas were, but no one could answer. The brahmana accompanying Him from Mathura also did not know. \u201cBeing the omniscient Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya, carefully searched and discovered the two Kundas in two paddy fields. He joyfully took a bath in whatever little water was there and glorified the Kundas in various ways. Then He marked His forehead with mud from the Kundas. \u201cThe villagers were greatly startled by His behavior. One of them inquired, \u2018From where has this sanyasi suddenly come?' Someone said, \u2018O brother, by seeing Him I cannot understand what is happening in my body.' Another person said, \u2018He cannot be a mortal sanyasi. Seeing Him I cannot explain what is happening in my mind.' \u201cSomeone else said, \u2018Who says He is a sanyasi? He is Krishna Himself appearing in this dress and form. Just see the proof. Different birds are all coming for His darshana. The cuckoos and parrots are happily addressing Him as Krishna, and the peacocks are dancing in jubilation. The different sounds of the birds are very pleasing to the ears. \u2018O brother, I repeatedly glorify the good fortune of these creatures, who are seeing Krishna in this form and dress. Dear brothers, let us offer obeisances unto the feet of the Lord, who has incarnated to distribute knowledge to the people. Speaking like this amongst themselves, they all became maddened by the nectarine sight of Mahaprabhu at this holiest site. Even Lord Brahma cannot describe a fragment of Mahaprabhu's ecstatic expression when He discovered these Kundas."

This means an individual\u2019s eager desire leads one to be in the company of a God realized Saint which is called \u201cSadhu Sanga\u201d, in order to learn the methods of spiritual practices for God-realization alone and for no other purpose. In the next stage, one follows the instructions of a spiritual master and begins the process of \u201cBhajan-Kriya\u201d, devotional practices like\nListening, Singing and Chanting the Qualities of God with his mind. By execution of devotional practises, one becomes free from all material attachment (\u201dAnartha Nivritti\u201d), attains \u201cNishtha\u201d i.e steadiness, and thereafter acquires a \u201cRuchi\u201d, taste for hearing about Sri Krishna. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for Krishna called \u201cAsakti\u201d, which is matured in \u201cBhava\u201d, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God where one develops an intense longing for his Beloved Lord. Here a devotee, doesn\u2019t wastes his time, even for the twinkling of an eye without being constantly engaged in his Bhajans. He sometimes feels the presence of Krishna near him, and is drowned in the stream of ecstasy (the menifestation of \u201cSatvik Bhao\u201d). Last Stage is called \u201cPrema\u201d, Pure (Real) love for God. the highest perfectional stage of life where the Spiritual Master bestows his special mercy and grace to his completely surrendered disciple and give him \u201cPrema\u201d. So, by the process of devotional service, under the guidance of the spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage of divine bliss, being freed from all material attachment. Then thereafter one can ultimately reach to the abode of the Supreme Lord, \u201cGolok Dham\u201d to serve God."

This means an individual\u2019s eager desire leads one to be in the company of a God realized Saint which is called \u201cSadhu Sanga\u201d, in order to learn the methods of spiritual practices for God-realization alone and for no other purpose. In the next stage, one follows the instructions of a spiritual master and begins the process of \u201cBhajan-Kriya\u201d, devotional practices like\nListening, Singing and Chanting the Qualities of God with his mind. By execution of devotional practises, one becomes free from all material attachment (\u201dAnartha Nivritti\u201d), attains \u201cNishtha\u201d i.e steadiness, and thereafter acquires a \u201cRuchi\u201d, taste for hearing about Sri Krishna. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for Krishna called \u201cAsakti\u201d, which is matured in \u201cBhava\u201d, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God where one develops an intense longing for his Beloved Lord. Here a devotee, doesn\u2019t wastes his time, even for the twinkling of an eye without being constantly engaged in his Bhajans. He sometimes feels the presence of Krishna near him, and is drowned in the stream of ecstasy (the menifestation of \u201cSatvik Bhao\u201d). Last Stage is called \u201cPrema\u201d, Pure (Real) love for God. the highest perfectional stage of life where the Spiritual Master bestows his special mercy and grace to his completely surrendered disciple and give him \u201cPrema\u201d. So, by the process of devotional service, under the guidance of the spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage of divine bliss, being freed from all material attachment. Then thereafter one can ultimately reach to the abode of the Supreme Lord, \u201cGolok Dham\u201d to serve God."

(All are born alone and die alone). All these companions made in this world in the course of the time only. The world is trapped in false attachments, so people mourn for father, son, mother, father-in-law, son in law, wife, friend, master, disciple, wealth, brothers etc. as they believe they all are their own. Bhagvat Rasik ji says that, due to lack of experience, people have been lost in the false, temporary happiness of the world so that they have gone unaware of the ultimate truth of human life that, Who we are, where we are going, where we are coming from, for which reason we come for etc."

She is beautifying the throne of gold, studded with gems and is putting even personified adornment to shame by the sweetness of Her beauty. She is wearing a crescent-shaped ornament on the crown of gold, studded with gems. Her bashful eyes are naturally of the colour of collyrium and embarrass even lotuses. The nose-ring and the besara in the nose are swinging and jolting Absolutely indescribable is the beauty of the pearl chain extending from the nose-ring up to the ear. Jewelled and flower shaped earrings made of gold are graced in Her ears and the necklaces of gems and pearls are prettified on Her chest Her head is covered with a blue coloured chunari and Her blouse and lehenga are blue as well. The gem-studded kankanas, bracelets and bangles around Her wrists are looking extremely charming and absolutely captivating is the henna on Her hands. Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji says that Kishori Ji's lotus-feet are looking ineffably beautiful with red mihura, jingling anklets and taking toe rings."

She is beautifying the throne of gold, studded with gems and is putting even personified adornment to shame by the sweetness of Her beauty. She is wearing a crescent-shaped ornament on the crown of gold, studded with gems. Her bashful eyes are naturally of the colour of collyrium and embarrass even lotuses. The nose-ring and the besara in the nose are swinging and jolting Absolutely indescribable is the beauty of the pearl chain extending from the nose-ring up to the ear. Jewelled and flower shaped earrings made of gold are graced in Her ears and the necklaces of gems and pearls are prettified on Her chest Her head is covered with a blue coloured chunari and Her blouse and lehenga are blue as well. The gem-studded kankanas, bracelets and bangles around Her wrists are looking extremely charming and absolutely captivating is the henna on Her hands. Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji says that Kishori Ji's lotus-feet are looking ineffably beautiful with red mihura, jingling anklets and taking toe rings."

his divinity, instantly mended it with his sacred thread. Some of the Vaishnavas complained about his behavior of removing his sacred thread of tulsi beaded necklace and putting it on Shri Radha\u2019s feet. He, in fact, was very firm on his decision as he suggested for what purpose is this sacred thread to me if it cannot be used in the service of Shri Radharani. Seeing this moment, everyone was stunned.\nDivine Pastimes of Shri Sewak Ji:\n(Damodardas Ji): Damodardas Ji was a disciple of Shri Hitharivansh Ji. Shri Sewak ji merged with a banyan tree becoming one with the Lord near Raas Mandala in Vrindavan.\nDivine Pastimes of Shri Dhruvdas Ji:\nShri Dhruvdas Ji: Dhruvdas Ji became a disciple of Shri Gopinathji, the third son of Shri Hit Harivanshji. Near Raas Mandal, Shri Radha-Krishna appeared once for his ardent desire. Actually sighting the Lord he composed padas compiled in the text \u2018Bayalees Leela\u2019 which showed the divine path to several bhaktas.\nTimings of Temple:\nSummer\nMangla Aarti: 06:00 AM\nShayan Aarti: 7:15 PM\nWinter\nMangla Aarti: 06:30 AM\nShayan Aarti: 6:15 PM\nLocation:\nHit Raas Mandal is located at the bank of Yamuna, near to Cheer Ghat."

his divinity, instantly mended it with his sacred thread. Some of the Vaishnavas complained about his behavior of removing his sacred thread of tulsi beaded necklace and putting it on Shri Radha\u2019s feet. He, in fact, was very firm on his decision as he suggested for what purpose is this sacred thread to me if it cannot be used in the service of Shri Radharani. Seeing this moment, everyone was stunned.\nDivine Pastimes of Shri Sewak Ji:\n(Damodardas Ji): Damodardas Ji was a disciple of Shri Hitharivansh Ji. Shri Sewak ji merged with a banyan tree becoming one with the Lord near Raas Mandala in Vrindavan.\nDivine Pastimes of Shri Dhruvdas Ji:\nShri Dhruvdas Ji: Dhruvdas Ji became a disciple of Shri Gopinathji, the third son of Shri Hit Harivanshji. Near Raas Mandal, Shri Radha-Krishna appeared once for his ardent desire. Actually sighting the Lord he composed padas compiled in the text \u2018Bayalees Leela\u2019 which showed the divine path to several bhaktas.\nTimings of Temple:\nSummer\nMangla Aarti: 06:00 AM\nShayan Aarti: 7:15 PM\nWinter\nMangla Aarti: 06:30 AM\nShayan Aarti: 6:15 PM\nLocation:\nHit Raas Mandal is located at the bank of Yamuna, near to Cheer Ghat."

Shri Radha is describing to Hita Sajni during the time when Shri Krishn went to pick up some flowers for Shri Radha in different groves. Priya Ji said, oh Sakhi! whatever beloved Krishna does, I like all of them and whatever is favorite of me, he does the same.\nIf only I have a pleasant place to stay in his eyes, then he also wants to become my apple of eyes.\u00a0 Oh, friend! He is my Beloved even more than my body, mind, and soul. But He has sacrificed his millions of lives unto me.\nBeing inspired by her divine love, Shree Hita Sajani said, Oh Radhe Krishn, the form of dark and fair complexion, you both are like male Swan and female Swan of Vrindavan. You both are one like water and wave, who can separate you duo from each other."

Shri Radha is describing to Hita Sajni during the time when Shri Krishn went to pick up some flowers for Shri Radha in different groves. Priya Ji said, oh Sakhi! whatever beloved Krishna does, I like all of them and whatever is favorite of me, he does the same.\nIf only I have a pleasant place to stay in his eyes, then he also wants to become my apple of eyes.\u00a0 Oh, friend! He is my Beloved even more than my body, mind, and soul. But He has sacrificed his millions of lives unto me.\nBeing inspired by her divine love, Shree Hita Sajani said, Oh Radhe Krishn, the form of dark and fair complexion, you both are like male Swan and female Swan of Vrindavan. You both are one like water and wave, who can separate you duo from each other."

A little further on, Shriman Mahaprabhu saw a female and male parrot (Sari and Shuka) sitting opposite each other on two branches of a tree, lovingly quarreling about the glories of the Divine Couple, Shri Radha-Krishna.\nShuk: My Krishna is Madan-mohana, the enchanter of Cupid\u2019s mind.\nSari: Yes, Off-course He is as long as my Radha is at His left side. Other-wise, He is only Madana (Cupid).\nShuk: My Krishna lifted Giriraja Goverdhan on His finger.\nSari: That\u2019s all because my Radha transmitted power into Him, otherwise, how could he have done so?\nShuk: My Krishna is the life of the whole universe.\nSari: My Radha is the life of that life.\nShuk: My Krishna\u2019s head is beautifully decorated with a peacock feather.\nSari: Only because my Radha\u2019s name is marked on that feather.\nShuk: The peacock-feather on my Krishna\u2019s head leans to the left.\nSari: Because it wants to bow down to my Radha\u2019s feet.\nShuk: My Krishna is the moon.\nSari: My Radha is the trap that captures that moon.\nShuka: There is no need to quarrel uselessly. Let us glorify the Youthful Couple together.\nSari: I happily agree to this. Let us chant the glories of the divine couple together.\nThis loving quarrel between the Shuka and Sari is also described in Govinda-lilamrita. (13.29), While listening to the quarrel of Shuka and Sari, Shriman Mahaprabhu Chaitanya got absorbed in the glory of the divine couple Shri Shyama Shyam."

A little further on, Shriman Mahaprabhu saw a female and male parrot (Sari and Shuka) sitting opposite each other on two branches of a tree, lovingly quarreling about the glories of the Divine Couple, Shri Radha-Krishna.\nShuk: My Krishna is Madan-mohana, the enchanter of Cupid\u2019s mind.\nSari: Yes, Off-course He is as long as my Radha is at His left side. Other-wise, He is only Madana (Cupid).\nShuk: My Krishna lifted Giriraja Goverdhan on His finger.\nSari: That\u2019s all because my Radha transmitted power into Him, otherwise, how could he have done so?\nShuk: My Krishna is the life of the whole universe.\nSari: My Radha is the life of that life.\nShuk: My Krishna\u2019s head is beautifully decorated with a peacock feather.\nSari: Only because my Radha\u2019s name is marked on that feather.\nShuk: The peacock-feather on my Krishna\u2019s head leans to the left.\nSari: Because it wants to bow down to my Radha\u2019s feet.\nShuk: My Krishna is the moon.\nSari: My Radha is the trap that captures that moon.\nShuka: There is no need to quarrel uselessly. Let us glorify the Youthful Couple together.\nSari: I happily agree to this. Let us chant the glories of the divine couple together.\nThis loving quarrel between the Shuka and Sari is also described in Govinda-lilamrita. (13.29), While listening to the quarrel of Shuka and Sari, Shriman Mahaprabhu Chaitanya got absorbed in the glory of the divine couple Shri Shyama Shyam."

Both are like 'chatak' (the bird who lives solely on raindrops and dies without it) as well as raindrops for each other. Both are like clouds and the thunder lightning for each other. Both are like Lotus and the Bumble Bee for each other. Both are like magnets and the iron for each other. Both are lovers and both are joy giver of their love. Both are like 'zuraffa' (one type of wonder animal) who is always lost in looking at each other. They both are like peacocks and Mud-rock (where a peacock loves to look at its shadow and being immersed in joy it dances) for each other. Both are like the buck that gets drawn to music while both are that musical rhythm themselves. Both are crest jewels and both are like the serpent that gets enchanted by the shining stones. Both are like the fish that cannot survive without water and both are water (for that fish) as well. Both love each other exactly the same way. They both are living only by watching the faces of each other. Both drink the nectar of love ('Adharamrit') from each other and yet they never get satisfied, and they can never be separated from each other even for half a moment."

Both are like 'chatak' (the bird who lives solely on raindrops and dies without it) as well as raindrops for each other. Both are like clouds and the thunder lightning for each other. Both are like Lotus and the Bumble Bee for each other. Both are like magnets and the iron for each other. Both are lovers and both are joy giver of their love. Both are like 'zuraffa' (one type of wonder animal) who is always lost in looking at each other. They both are like peacocks and Mud-rock (where a peacock loves to look at its shadow and being immersed in joy it dances) for each other. Both are like the buck that gets drawn to music while both are that musical rhythm themselves. Both are crest jewels and both are like the serpent that gets enchanted by the shining stones. Both are like the fish that cannot survive without water and both are water (for that fish) as well. Both love each other exactly the same way. They both are living only by watching the faces of each other. Both drink the nectar of love ('Adharamrit') from each other and yet they never get satisfied, and they can never be separated from each other even for half a moment."

Since childhood, he was devoid of worldly desires and had a great devotion to Radha Krishn and Swami Shri Haridas Ji.\nAs per birth dates Sri Swami Vitthal Vipul Dev ji was 5 years elder to Swami Haridasji and was his first disciple. With the association of Swami Shri Haridas Ji, he had a vision of Shri Radha-Krishna at Nidhi Van and his life was blessed. When Swami Shri Haridas Ji entered Nikunja, Shri Vipuldev ji was deeply pained and tied a bandage on his eyes. Several rasiks arranged for the Raas and it is believed that Shri Radha asked him to open the eyes and the moment he did so, he saw Shri Radharani. Sri Vithul Vipul Dev ji prayed to Priyaji not to leave his hand and to always keep him with her always. Leaving his body he became one with her. It is believed that Shri Radharani transformed his body in sakhi swaroop."

Since childhood, he was devoid of worldly desires and had a great devotion to Radha Krishn and Swami Shri Haridas Ji.\nAs per birth dates Sri Swami Vitthal Vipul Dev ji was 5 years elder to Swami Haridasji and was his first disciple. With the association of Swami Shri Haridas Ji, he had a vision of Shri Radha-Krishna at Nidhi Van and his life was blessed. When Swami Shri Haridas Ji entered Nikunja, Shri Vipuldev ji was deeply pained and tied a bandage on his eyes. Several rasiks arranged for the Raas and it is believed that Shri Radha asked him to open the eyes and the moment he did so, he saw Shri Radharani. Sri Vithul Vipul Dev ji prayed to Priyaji not to leave his hand and to always keep him with her always. Leaving his body he became one with her. It is believed that Shri Radharani transformed his body in sakhi swaroop."

This is the place at Vrindavan, where Krishna disguised Himself as a boatman, in order to take the gopis across the Yamuna River in His boat. Krishna covered Himself with a large cloak so that the gopis could not recognize Him. On that day, the gopis were on their way to sell milk products in a market on the other side of the Yamuna, but when the gopis arrived on the river-bank, they found there was only one boat owned by a very strange looking boatman dressed in a large cloak. This boatman agreed to take the gopis in his boat, but insisted that before they could ride in His boat, He would first have to bathe the feet of at least one gopi, only then could the gopis ride on his boat. At first the gopis objected to this proposal, but seeing no other boat in sight, they agreed to the boatman\u2019s unusual request, asking which particular gopi\u2019s feet the boatman wanted to bathe. The boatman, after some discussion with his boat, chose Radharani, and then very elaborately bathed Radharani\u2019s feet with great pomp and ceremony. The boatman then sprinkled the bathing water over his head, and then over his boat, and then over the Yamuna. The gopis were then able to board the boat and the boatman started rowing towards the other shore.\nIn the middle of the river the boatman suddenly stopped boating, complaining of weakness due to lack of food, and suggested that the gopis should feed him with some of their milk products in order for him to regain his strength. At first the gopis refused and threatened to report his behavior to King Kamsa, the powerful ruler of Mathura, but seeing no alternative, they ultimately agreed, and fed the boatman with some milk sweets, butter, and yogurt. After enjoying the milk products, the boatman again began rowing, but due to being completely bloated with milk products, soon slumped over and lay motionless on the floor of the boat. Radharani asked one of the gopis to see what was wrong with the boatman. Lifting the boatman\u2019s cloak to see what the problem was, she suddenly burst out laughing while pulling Krishna\u2019s flute from under His waistband. Having discovered the boatman\u2019s true identity, all the gopis began laughing and clapping their hands. The gopis then rowed the boat themselves to the other shore."

This is the place at Vrindavan, where Krishna disguised Himself as a boatman, in order to take the gopis across the Yamuna River in His boat. Krishna covered Himself with a large cloak so that the gopis could not recognize Him. On that day, the gopis were on their way to sell milk products in a market on the other side of the Yamuna, but when the gopis arrived on the river-bank, they found there was only one boat owned by a very strange looking boatman dressed in a large cloak. This boatman agreed to take the gopis in his boat, but insisted that before they could ride in His boat, He would first have to bathe the feet of at least one gopi, only then could the gopis ride on his boat. At first the gopis objected to this proposal, but seeing no other boat in sight, they agreed to the boatman\u2019s unusual request, asking which particular gopi\u2019s feet the boatman wanted to bathe. The boatman, after some discussion with his boat, chose Radharani, and then very elaborately bathed Radharani\u2019s feet with great pomp and ceremony. The boatman then sprinkled the bathing water over his head, and then over his boat, and then over the Yamuna. The gopis were then able to board the boat and the boatman started rowing towards the other shore.\nIn the middle of the river the boatman suddenly stopped boating, complaining of weakness due to lack of food, and suggested that the gopis should feed him with some of their milk products in order for him to regain his strength. At first the gopis refused and threatened to report his behavior to King Kamsa, the powerful ruler of Mathura, but seeing no alternative, they ultimately agreed, and fed the boatman with some milk sweets, butter, and yogurt. After enjoying the milk products, the boatman again began rowing, but due to being completely bloated with milk products, soon slumped over and lay motionless on the floor of the boat. Radharani asked one of the gopis to see what was wrong with the boatman. Lifting the boatman\u2019s cloak to see what the problem was, she suddenly burst out laughing while pulling Krishna\u2019s flute from under His waistband. Having discovered the boatman\u2019s true identity, all the gopis began laughing and clapping their hands. The gopis then rowed the boat themselves to the other shore."

Shri Radhika saw a tree with a branch full of flowers. Knowing that she was coming to\nKusuma-sarovara\nto pick flowers, playful Krishna had climbed that very tree. Using all His weight, He pushed the branch down and remained hidden in the foliage so that Shri Radhika could not see Him. Radhika pulled down that branch with one hand, and was absorbed in picking its flowers with the other when suddenly Krsna shifted to another branch. The branch sprung up, lifting up Radhika with it and She cried out for help. Sri Krsna leapt out from the tree and caught hanging Srimatiji in His arms. The sakhis began clapping and laughing loudly, but Srimati Radhika, released Herself from Sri Krsna's embrace and scolded Him harshly."

Shri Radhika saw a tree with a branch full of flowers. Knowing that she was coming to\nKusuma-sarovara\nto pick flowers, playful Krishna had climbed that very tree. Using all His weight, He pushed the branch down and remained hidden in the foliage so that Shri Radhika could not see Him. Radhika pulled down that branch with one hand, and was absorbed in picking its flowers with the other when suddenly Krsna shifted to another branch. The branch sprung up, lifting up Radhika with it and She cried out for help. Sri Krsna leapt out from the tree and caught hanging Srimatiji in His arms. The sakhis began clapping and laughing loudly, but Srimati Radhika, released Herself from Sri Krsna's embrace and scolded Him harshly."

Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu Established Shri Radhavallabh Lal more than 500 years ago. At that time, Vrindavan was a dense forest. There were no Saints, devotees at that time, Vrindavan was under the Mughal empire. At that time, Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu came to Vrindavan and installed Shri Radhavallabh Ji at Madan Ter. He built a temple only with creepers and Shri Radhavallabh Ji stayed there. During the era of Shri Hit Harivansh, no concrete temple built ever, He did not allow it to build. Many people came with the proposal to build a concrete grand temple, but He refused. He always opposed the concrete temples. Old Radhavallabh Temple (Now known as \u2018Hith Mandir\u2019)in Vrindavan was constructed in 1584 by Sundardas Bhatnagar, a disciple of Sri Vanachandraji, son of Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu, founder of the Radhavallabh sect. Abdul Rahim Khankhana, the chief head at Akbar's court, in whose employment Sundardas Bhatnagar of Deoband was, got Royal permission to use red sandstone for the construction of temple. Traditions and legacy make the Radhavallabh temple the oldest heritage of Vrindavan. Later on Shri Radha Vallabh Lal shifted to Shri Radha Vallabh Lal temple (building on the back side of the temple) and remains virajman there till date."

Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu Established Shri Radhavallabh Lal more than 500 years ago. At that time, Vrindavan was a dense forest. There were no Saints, devotees at that time, Vrindavan was under the Mughal empire. At that time, Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu came to Vrindavan and installed Shri Radhavallabh Ji at Madan Ter. He built a temple only with creepers and Shri Radhavallabh Ji stayed there. During the era of Shri Hit Harivansh, no concrete temple built ever, He did not allow it to build. Many people came with the proposal to build a concrete grand temple, but He refused. He always opposed the concrete temples. Old Radhavallabh Temple (Now known as \u2018Hith Mandir\u2019)in Vrindavan was constructed in 1584 by Sundardas Bhatnagar, a disciple of Sri Vanachandraji, son of Hith Harivansh Mahaprabhu, founder of the Radhavallabh sect. Abdul Rahim Khankhana, the chief head at Akbar's court, in whose employment Sundardas Bhatnagar of Deoband was, got Royal permission to use red sandstone for the construction of temple. Traditions and legacy make the Radhavallabh temple the oldest heritage of Vrindavan. Later on Shri Radha Vallabh Lal shifted to Shri Radha Vallabh Lal temple (building on the back side of the temple) and remains virajman there till date."

believed that he got the direct grace of Shri Hit Harivansh Ji. He did not listen to his lectures, but he was the greatest knower of Sri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu's \"Rasopasna\" theory which is \"Radha Charan Pradhaan Nitya Vihaar Upasna\". He remained only ten days in Vrindavan and yet he holds a position which no other disciple of Harivansh Ji has ever achieved. The proof is that his speeches are written today with the divine words of Shri Hit Harivans Ji in Shri Hit Chaurasi.\nHe was born in the year 1577 in Jabalpur, in a village named 'Gada'. He was born in a Brahmin family and since childhood, he was a devotee of Lord. In the same family, there was a person named Chattrabhuja das who was also a devotee like him.\nIn his village, once a few disciples of Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu reached 'Gada' while performing preaching of Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu's \"Rasopasna\". After listening to the lectures, Sewak Ji and Chaturbujadas Ji were very impressed and they went to Vrindavan and decided to seek initiation from Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu. But unfortunately, Hitharivansh had entered into Nikunj Leela and it was heartbreaking for both of them. Chaturbujdas Ji then thought of taking initiation from Acharya Van Chandra Das, the eldest son of Hitharivsh Ji. He also offered the proposal to Sewak Ji, but Sewak Ji said that I have accepted Shri Harivish Mahaprabhu as my guru and there is no question at all of taking initiation from anyone else. Not only that, he said, he will take initiation only from Shri Hit Harivansh Ji else he will die, but will not take initiation from anyone else. Chaturujadas was amazed to see his exclusive devotion towards Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu.\nChaturujadas Ji repeatedly requested Sewak Ji, but he failed, And went to Vrindavan all alone and returned after taking initiation from Shri Acharya Vanchandra Das. But after returning, he was surprised to see that Sewak Ji is chanting the same mantra affectionately that Van Chand Ji had given him. Sewak Ji revealed that he was blessed with Harivansh Ji's kindness and he received the mantra in his dream from him. He even saw the divine Vrindavan in his dream which Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu revealed to him.\nWhile chanting the mantra and while doing meditation of Radha Krishn, he received divine wisdom and grace. The verses of Shri Hita Harivansh's\u00a0 'rasopasna' in 'Hit Chaurasi' theory began to sprout in his heart and he started writing the deep meanings of those, which became renowned as the 'Sewak Vani' later. He was recognized as a commentator of Hitchaurasi Verses written by Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu. When Shri Van Chandra Ji, son of Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu, saw the deep meanings of those verses, he immediately ordered that the meaning written by Sewak Ji should be published with 'Hit Chaurasi'.\nVan Chandra Ji was so much impressed by Sewak Ji that his desire to see Sewak Ji kept increasing day by day. He invited Sewak Ji to come to Vrindavan and Sewak Ji could not ignore the invitation of Van Chandra Ji. He himself was eager to visit Radha Vallabh Lal Ji at Vrindavan. So He considered this invitation as an invitation by Shri Radha Vallabh Ji. After reaching Vrindavan, he went to the temple of Shri Radha Vallabh. Van Chandara Das saw his 'bhava' while he was doing darshan of Radha Vallabh and he immediately recognized that he could only be Damodar Das (Sewak Ji). He was happy and gave him a loving embrace. It is said that Sewak Ji could only live in Vrindavan for a few days (for about 10 days). The day has arrived, when it was one year since Shri Hit Harivansh has entered Nikunj Leela and on the same day he was sitting in meditational state, It is believed that he also entered in Nikunj Leela under a tree in the Ras Mandal (also known as Raseshwari Radha Rani Mandir, near Seva Kunj). His Samadhi is also located at Raas Mandal."

believed that he got the direct grace of Shri Hit Harivansh Ji. He did not listen to his lectures, but he was the greatest knower of Sri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu's \"Rasopasna\" theory which is \"Radha Charan Pradhaan Nitya Vihaar Upasna\". He remained only ten days in Vrindavan and yet he holds a position which no other disciple of Harivansh Ji has ever achieved. The proof is that his speeches are written today with the divine words of Shri Hit Harivans Ji in Shri Hit Chaurasi.\nHe was born in the year 1577 in Jabalpur, in a village named 'Gada'. He was born in a Brahmin family and since childhood, he was a devotee of Lord. In the same family, there was a person named Chattrabhuja das who was also a devotee like him.\nIn his village, once a few disciples of Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu reached 'Gada' while performing preaching of Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu's \"Rasopasna\". After listening to the lectures, Sewak Ji and Chaturbujadas Ji were very impressed and they went to Vrindavan and decided to seek initiation from Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu. But unfortunately, Hitharivansh had entered into Nikunj Leela and it was heartbreaking for both of them. Chaturbujdas Ji then thought of taking initiation from Acharya Van Chandra Das, the eldest son of Hitharivsh Ji. He also offered the proposal to Sewak Ji, but Sewak Ji said that I have accepted Shri Harivish Mahaprabhu as my guru and there is no question at all of taking initiation from anyone else. Not only that, he said, he will take initiation only from Shri Hit Harivansh Ji else he will die, but will not take initiation from anyone else. Chaturujadas was amazed to see his exclusive devotion towards Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu.\nChaturujadas Ji repeatedly requested Sewak Ji, but he failed, And went to Vrindavan all alone and returned after taking initiation from Shri Acharya Vanchandra Das. But after returning, he was surprised to see that Sewak Ji is chanting the same mantra affectionately that Van Chand Ji had given him. Sewak Ji revealed that he was blessed with Harivansh Ji's kindness and he received the mantra in his dream from him. He even saw the divine Vrindavan in his dream which Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu revealed to him.\nWhile chanting the mantra and while doing meditation of Radha Krishn, he received divine wisdom and grace. The verses of Shri Hita Harivansh's\u00a0 'rasopasna' in 'Hit Chaurasi' theory began to sprout in his heart and he started writing the deep meanings of those, which became renowned as the 'Sewak Vani' later. He was recognized as a commentator of Hitchaurasi Verses written by Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu. When Shri Van Chandra Ji, son of Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu, saw the deep meanings of those verses, he immediately ordered that the meaning written by Sewak Ji should be published with 'Hit Chaurasi'.\nVan Chandra Ji was so much impressed by Sewak Ji that his desire to see Sewak Ji kept increasing day by day. He invited Sewak Ji to come to Vrindavan and Sewak Ji could not ignore the invitation of Van Chandra Ji. He himself was eager to visit Radha Vallabh Lal Ji at Vrindavan. So He considered this invitation as an invitation by Shri Radha Vallabh Ji. After reaching Vrindavan, he went to the temple of Shri Radha Vallabh. Van Chandara Das saw his 'bhava' while he was doing darshan of Radha Vallabh and he immediately recognized that he could only be Damodar Das (Sewak Ji). He was happy and gave him a loving embrace. It is said that Sewak Ji could only live in Vrindavan for a few days (for about 10 days). The day has arrived, when it was one year since Shri Hit Harivansh has entered Nikunj Leela and on the same day he was sitting in meditational state, It is believed that he also entered in Nikunj Leela under a tree in the Ras Mandal (also known as Raseshwari Radha Rani Mandir, near Seva Kunj). His Samadhi is also located at Raas Mandal."
